    "1. Lowercasing: Convert all tokens to lowercase to ensure consistency, especially since text data can be case-sensitive.\n",
    "2. Removing Stopwords: Stopwords are common words (like \"and,\" \"the,\" \"is\") that usually don't carry significant meaning. Removing them can help focus on more meaningful words.\n",
    "3. Stemming or Lemmatization:Stemming: Reduces words to their root form, which may not always be a real word (e.g., \"running\" to \"run\"). Lemmatization: Similar to stemming but produces real words (e.g., \"better\" to \"good\").\n",
    "4.  Feature Extraction: Convert the tokens into a format that a machine learning model can understand. Common methods include:\n",
    "    * Bag of Words: Counts the frequency of each word in a document.\n",
    "    * TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Weighs words by how unique they are across documents.\n",
    "    * Word Embeddings: Like Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT, which capture semantic meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Sentiment Analysis or Classification: Apply a machine learning model (like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or a deep learning model) to classify the sentiment of the text or perform another type of analysis.\n",
    "6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of your model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or confusion matrix to determine how well your model is performing.\n",
    "7. Interpretation and Insights: Based on the analysis, derive insights about customer sentiments, common themes, or any other patterns that emerge from the data.\n",
    "8. Visualization: Visualize the results using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or WordClouds to make your findings more accessible and understandable."

      "Top features for class 'Not Verified |   We travel extensively over 25 years and tend to use BA on our regular trips where possible and in recent years we have had overall good service from them however more recently we have experienced flight delays, operational issues, flight cancellations, poor check-in experiences etc. On our last two recent trips, one to Zurich and another to Iceland they had cancelled our return flight an hour or so prior to the scheduled departure time despite the flight showing as on time and no problems being reported. We have just returned from Iceland and our experience was one of the worst we have ever had with BA. Again our flight was just cancelled due to operational reasons but what made matters worse on this occasion was the flight was quite early at 7:45am. We went to bed at around 11pm (night before), checked the flight and it showed as being on time with again no issues being reported so we went to sleep fairly rest assured the the flight would be fine. We woke up at 5:30am and then discovered our flight had been cancelled without any warning! We were then left with virtually no other return flight options for that day. It soon got worse as the earliest flight option then being offered by BA was 3 days later! We opted to choose Tuesday with BA as we were left with no other option! If we hadn't acted quickly the Tuesday availability was sure to sell out leaving us with a return option of Wednesday onwards having experienced the same problem with BA in Zurich back in December. We were lucky on this occasion as BA offered several flights back on the same day in Zurich but this wasn't the case with Iceland! We were then left in a right predicament as hotel availability in Iceland was very limited to non existent given the very short notice of our cancelled flight. Our hotel was fully booked and our hire car had to be returned to the airport. From a logistical point of view this was a complete nightmare having to then rebook another hire car and to find alternative hotels. We then decided to search for any in-direct flights online to get us back to the UK sooner with another airline and after a good half hour of searching we came across an in-direct flight into Gatwick with Norwegian Air but it went via Oslo and a total journey time of 8 hours! This was not ideal as our car was in Heathrow! Assessing our options which were virtually none, we had no guarantees that the flight with BA on Tuesday would also have proceeded on time and checking with Norwegian Air both flights were on time and looked promising so we decided to get these booked at an additional expense of £600! If we had stayed in Iceland we would have also incurred additional cost to then fight back with BA or the insurance company. Our priority was to return home ASAP as we had important work and personal commitments on the Monday so we had to return ASAP. We eventually flew back fine with Norwegian Air and the service we received was far superior to that of BA. The boarding process was slick on both flights compared to a complete shambles with BA. Norwegian Air offered a full food trolley service with soft drinks, tea's and also a range of alcoholic drinks. Compare this to just the water and snack bar on BA!! Both flights were on time and we eventually landed in Gatwick shortly after our expected arrival time. We got back very late home after having to then book a hire car at Gatwick and in the morning we contacted BA to cancel our alternative Tuesday flight ':\n",

Waited for 5 hours, three extra hours, for our connection to Porto then the cancelled the flight. Scrambled for a hotel and a new flight the next day. They routed us through Madrid the next morning. That flight was 1.5 hours late so we missed our connection to Porto. Because we missed the connection (their fault), they cancelled our return flights. After two hours on the phone with customer service from the Madrid airport, they booked us a new return flight, then they made is pay $ 1300 to fly from Madrid to Porto. Then, for no reason they cancelled our return flight again! After hours, and hours and hours with customer service, we finally got a return flight five days after our original return flight. Meanwhile, they lost my wife's luggage. We finally got 15 DAYS after they lost it. Return flight? More problems with our reservations. At no point was British Airways helpful. They left the onus on us to fix their mistakes at every turn. They completely ruined a three week vacation and they don't care. They wouldn't even let us speak to a supervisor or manager.

      "Top features for class 'Not Verified |  Another case of reviewing British Airways flights that they have not actually provided. I booked several months ago for London to Casablanca via Madrid (with the Madrid to Casablanca leg on Iberia), returning from Marrakech direct on BA. First the Marrakech flight was cancelled, so I had to rebook on Royal Air Maroc. Now BA has changed the London to Madrid leg to be operated by Iberia. So, instead of my booking through ba.com having 2 out of 3 legs operated by BA, I now have none of them being BA flights - and they did not transfer my paid-for seat selection on London to Madrid, so I have got to arrange a refund of the payment. What is the point of an airline offering a service and taking your money for that service, only to decide later that they cannot be bothered to provide what you have paid for in good faith?

Why have numbered boarding groups if you don’t use them. Cabin crew - Treated passengers as an inconvenience as they moved about the plane. At one point a passenger was coming out of the toilet as a crew member approached and the crew member just pushed the door closed pushing them back into the toilet as they went past, and without even a word. No acknowledgement when you stood aside to let them past. Service – We were in the final row of six in WT+ (which has a total of 48 seats). The lunch meal was brought out and we were the last people to be served (not unusual for back row seats) but when it came to us there was only the vegetarian option left of the 3 menu options. Cabin steward said that they had only been given 48 WT+ meals. There was a second hot meal served before we landed. Again, the same server got to us last and again there was only a vegetarian option left. I asked if it might not have been possible to commence serving this second meal from back to front so that we had a choice for at least one meal, and she said she hadn’t thought of that! Food – Some of it was inedible. Vegetarian Cannelloni had pasta so thick and uncooked neither of us could eat it. The bread roll was crispy like toast in the bottom half and soft in the top half. Only thing I could eat was the Baby Bel! In between meal snacks consisted of a 2 biscuit pack of shortbread, pretty basic. Drinks – They ran out of red wine 4 hours into an 11-hour flight. Toilets – There was no toilet accessible directly from the WT+ section. We had to walk halfway down the plane through Economy to reach a shared toilet.

Organised boarding, sparkling wine or orange on boarding (water or orange in BA), food options available (even in last row seats), better food, proper glasses/cups for drinks, dedicated toilet access, help yourself snacks, helpful service from cabin crew.

      "Top features for class 'Not Verified |  Booked a very special holiday for me and my partner, September arrived and we were on our way to lovely South of France, Booked Business Class for us both to start the holiday right. As we were checking I was told the flight was over booked and our seats wouldn't print onto the ticket for some reason. We had already made sure the seats were booked when we had booked the flights nearly a year prior to going. Unfortunately when we arrived at the gate we were then told we would no longer be sat together and one of us would in fact have to go into economy. My girlfriend is an extremely nervous flyer and so had to take extra tablets to remain calm, She didn't have any food which we had pre booked also and she was sat right down the bottom end of the flight. We were held at the gate with another 4 or 5 couples all in the same predicament all due to the lovely money grabbing British Airways over booking the flight. They ended up refusing passengers in the end and even had people sat on the fold down chairs in the toilet area. When we eventually arrived in France late, we was waiting for our luggage to come. Our airtags stated that both our cases was in fact still in Heathrow. We then had to wait 4 days for them to eventually come into France by this point our holiday was ruined. British Airways was absolutely shocking, we couldn't speak to anyone as all the phone numbers were no longer in use. We felt stranded in a foreign country with no clothes and no one to help use with what to do next. Every day we watched them case not moved as we were tracking with air tags. it was so frustrating not being able to plan our days in hope we would get the call to then drive all the way back to the air port 2 hours each way to collect our cases. we ended up going out and buying new clothes toiletries and all the stuff to make the best of our ruined holiday, saving all the receipts thinking we would be able to claim it all back. how wrong I was. British airways take zero responsibility and fob me off with going through my insurance. British Airways only pay for basic essentials, Pants and toothpaste. I filed a complaint when I got back and requested my money back for business class and they haven't even had the decency to even respond. They are an absolute joke of a company and I wish they would remove British out of there name because there is nothing British about them.

      "Top features for class 'Not Verified |  Cairo is a 5 hour flight and BA considers it to be short haul, so everyone is crammed in with knees pressed up against the seat in front and nothing in the way of inflight entertainment. Not even a magazine - which is now available by WiFi that you have to pay for. You have to pay for your seat choice, checked in baggage, food & drink, WiFi. Not that I have anything against that - I'm used to that on budget airlines - but this is for a premium price ticket. I would have preferred to fly on easyJet where the initial ticket would have been less, and the extras would have been half the price. The BA app and website makes it really difficult to understand the extras and we ended up with baggage on the wrong ticket so had to pay extra. And don't get me started on their customer service helpline. On board the staff are ok but on the long Cairo-London route they spend most of their time on a break where they use the back row or two and talk loudly without any consideration for the passengers. And for the flyers who don't want the hassle of charges, minimal cabin service, and budget seats, then they could easily provide a 'premium economy' option  and really make a difference for the experience. Heathrow Terminal 5 compounds the poor experience, especially for arrivals. It is also poorly served by transport links - especially for those of us who live near Gatwick which is being abandoned by BA. I have been a frequent flyer for many years - and was even a BA Gold Card holder at one point - so I know about the potential experience. I used be able to make the choice - do I fly budget, or do I fly more comfortably for more? Now it's a case of flying budget, or flying budget for double the price with BA. ':\n",

Flight on 18th June-2022 from Vancouver to London airport was delayed for roughly 4 hours. We received a 10 CAD voucher for some drinks, this was appreciated. Because of this delay we missed our connecting flight to Amsterdam (from London), within the airplane we have been informed to go towards the British airway information desk to reschedule another flight towards Amsterdam. When we left the airplane in London, there where 3 employees working and a 400 people waiting line. We asked around towards the nice employees British airways have and we have been told this was the only line/desks to get a reschedule for our flight to Amsterdam, so we had to wait and be patient. After 4 hours of waiting and being roughly halfway the line we felt like uninformed cattle in an 4h waiting line with only candy bars and sugar cookies to eat.  At some point after 4 hours they were giving away hotel vouchers and shuttle bus vouchers because we couldn’t sleep/stay at the airport, as we noticed on the website we have been assigned another flight. This flight was about to leave Tuesday morning (it was Sunday 5pm when we arrived in London). This meant we have to spent 2 additional days in London before we were able to fly to the Netherlands. We have been told by the employees we could arrange our own transfer back to the Netherlands and save the receipts, and we will get a refund on the costs (hotel, food, transport) and a refund on the flight for Tuesday as we where not going to take this flight. They released out baggage, gave us a hotel voucher and cancelled the Tuesday flight they gave us. We were going to make our own travel back to the Netherlands.

      "Top features for class 'Not Verified |  Everything was ok until our connecting flight in London, just before take off, we were on the runway, the pilot came on to announce an engine problem. After engineers tried to fix it while we waited on the plane for over an hour we were finally told that we would have to be evacuated and rebooked for another flight but not to worry because a special crew was waiting for us on the ground to help us and set us up in a hotel except that there was no one to help us. In fact everyone refused to help us. It was Saturday almost 8pm and they just wanted to go home. Anyone with a connecting flight couldn't rebook on the application because the app wouldn't disassociate our first flight with the connecting one in London and the staff saw this but still refused to help us. They gave us a phone number but there was only a message that said just to use the app. Finally I got someone on the phone who rebooked us for the next day. Now it's 10:30pm and I have to find a hotel room because the airline refused also to help us with that. So i had 2 choices either sleep in the airport or pay over 700GBP for a room. I don't have the money to pay for this but after a 10 hour flight, 8 hours of jet lag and the insane stress after the fact that no one from British Airways would help us I took the room. Of course I claimed reimbursement but that was over 3 weeks ago and I haven't heard anything since so I have no idea when or how much I'll be reimbursed, even though I'm not claiming any emotional compensation from the horrible situation they put me through due to their total indifference. It's financially difficult for me right now because the money I had to put out is equal to half my salary and of course it's impossible to reach them by phone. I feel still as i did on August 26 2023 completely trapped by them and their indifference with no solution or information':\n",

The plane was not fully booked and had lots of room overhead.

The flight itself was good, attendants were polite and helpful. No complains there. Just extremely unhappy with the gate agent service.

      "Top features for class 'Not Verified |  Feb 25, 2022. We show up at the airport 3 hours early for our flight to Dublin. we waited in line for 3+ hours to just check in our luggage. After that, we learn our flight is delayed another 3+ hours. We had a connecting flight in London. When trying to go through customs they wouldn't let us through because the boarding of the plane was going to be happening in 30 minutes. They told us to wait in a customer service line that was well over an hour. We then found out we could have gone through customs because the connecting flight from London to Dublin was delayed over an hour. However, by the time we were told this information, the doors were about to close. The next available flight to Dublin was 2/27 late evening. With that being said we were forced to stay the night in London. After talking to a British Airways manager, they informed us that BA would reimburse us for any hotel, flight (to get to Dublin regardless of the airline), clothes (due to them losing our bags), excursions and transportation. Due to this issue, we had to spend multiple days shopping for clothes, lost out on days we had booked to explore the country, had to now buy an extra suitcase for the new clothes we received (went 4 days with lost bags). When we finally got home, we submitted our claims like we were told to do. Within a few days, it's declined. We have asked for a contact # just to talk to somebody, again declined. We tried to reach out via social media and we get passive-aggressive messages.  They refuse to pay me back for the new flight to get to Dublin, transportation to and from the airport in London, the hotel for London, the clothes I had to buy because they lost my bags for 4 days, and the extra luggage fee because of the extra clothes I had to buy. There is no customer support and they are impossible to get a direct response from.':\n",

      "Top features for class 'Not Verified |  Feels like BA are putting the 'economy' back in 'premium economy'. Very pleasant, friendly and helpful cabin crew. However it was over two hours before food was served on this already-delayed 7.40pm flight. A single drink was offered in plastic cups before meal service, and with the food you were offered wine only, but the crew 'could come back later' if you wanted something else - including water! I drank wine anyway but I wouldn't leap at this offer given how long it took them to do food. I've never experienced this on other airlines' premium economy products (I flew WestJet this year and they took your drink orders just after you boarded, then brought them to you before, and then with, your meal in glassware - brilliant! Air New Zealand do glass and use your name throughout). Water eventually came round after we'd eaten. As I say, the crew was pleasant and friendly but seemed under-equipped, under-staffed or following poor procedures. Food was forgettable. In-flight entertainment was great and the screens large - unfortunately after every seatbelt light announcement the screens' brightness levels reset to their retina-searing default. Not fun on a night flight with turbulence. Loos on this Gatwick 777 were halfway down economy (which was pandemonium) or at the very back. The upside to this layout is that PE is next to the exit, so we deplaned very quickly. Check-in queue at Cancun took forever. Couldn't see or hear gate announcements so everyone crowded the gate. Grateful for priority boarding in this situation. Bags arrived OK at Gatwick, no delay. I continue to avoid BA unless using Avios for business class or where there is no alternative. BA's problems all seem so easy to fix - their cabin crew are clearly eager to help you, why aren't they equipped and given service procedures to match other airlines at this price point?':\n",

My only issue is that the flight was packed - understandable as it was just before Chirstmas but surely it is not wise to have strangers sitting so close to each other during a pandemic, even with the masks? My return flight was cancelled but it was easy to transfer to a new flight so no issues there either - just hoping for a little more personal space next time! Also wi-fi did not work. I also liked that they had a system for boarding and disembarking to avoid everyone rushing at the same time, brought in for the pandemic I'm sure but I hope this is something they continue into the future as it made the experience much more pleasant. Value for money marked down only because the Christmas flights were so expensive! To be expected though, I know.':\n",

      "Top features for class 'Not Verified |  Great thing about British Airways A380 is the economy section upstairs. Get this if you can as it allows you to have small stowage cupboards at the window seats. Despite being not very old, the A380 looked tired inside. Broken side stowage, a seat that reclined uncontrollably and slow to react IFE. The food was supposed to be Christmas dinner. 3 wafer thin bits of dry turkey, 4 over cooked sprouts and some cubed potatoes. Poor in taste and quality. Mousse desert was great though. Slight issue during the snack meal. Ordered a childs option which was marked as such. Regular meal arrived as well and they were exactly the same. Asked a crew member to be told the difference was the sticker on the box. Staff were ok. Couple decent but mostly just ok. Overall, BA just seems a tad cheap these days. Great to sit upstairs but that was where the enjoyment ended. Just seemed a bit dull and like BA are just an average airline.\n",

As they barely offer any food service anyway (small packet of crisps and an even smaller bottle of water) on a 45 minute flight, I wondered why they thought it was good operational planning to delay a whole plane load of passengers so that 6 people in business class could speedily eat a poor quality meal on the flight to Paris.

The British Airways customer care associates I talked with were great and caring and they were able to issue us travel credit for tickets that were non-refundable.

How can I make travel arrangements by May 2020 with the coronavirus out of control throughout the world and travel bans in place? I understand BA has policies in place, but I cannot understand how you can expect someone to make travel arrangements while the world is dealing with COVID-19. I feel this timeline is unfair to any consumer who has trust with their preferred airline, my preferred airline is still British Airways. British Airways needs to reevaluate their policies during a world crisis....and make adjustments as needed to be fair to consumers who trust them. Whether a consumer has purchased refundable or non-refundable tickets should not matter, because forcing a consumer to rebook while a world pandemic is happening and not adjusting your policies to the situation can change your loyal customers, remember, there are many other airlines out there to choose from. The coronavirus is something that no one has any control of. I guess the bottom line is I think British Airways needs to put some common sense to their policy. I want to rebook and travel, but I am hesitant to this at this time. Hopefully, May 2020 this pandemic is over for all of us. ':\n",

When I asked for help ahead of time, I was told to run to the next gate. Needless to say, I missed my flight. There were three British Airways employees at the customer service desk when I was next in line at Heathrow, and two of them went on break despite the ever-growing line (due to multiple people missing their flights with the same airlines under similar circumstances). After 45 additional minutes waiting for assistance, I was given a receipt -not a boarding pass, which caused issues at the next connecting flight from Barcelona to Rome, which was coordinated through British Airways. And this was just on the outbound trip! On the return trip, the British Airways flight ended up landing 15 minutes late and landed while my connecting flight was boarding—downstairs from the exit gate. I was denied entry to my connecting flight because I was 15 minutes past the time when they started to board, because of the delay by British airways. The boarding didn’t close for an hour and didn’t leave for another hour and a half later (according to the notifications on my phone). So, instead of being helped, I was denied entry because I missed the beginning of boarding by 15 minutes due to the connecting flight delay. Again, I waited in the customer service line at Heathrow to reschedule my flight. I already had my boarding pass in hand! I still haven’t made it to my final destination.  I do not recommend Heathrow Airport either. The British Airlines employee came to me when she saw me upset after being denied to board on my return flight, and asked what happened. Her solution to my problem was do not fly British Airways in the future. Thanks a lot, lady. I already figured that out on my own. I was given a £10 meal voucher, bus voucher, and hotel voucher due to the many inconveniences, but I have not flown any airlines ever before in my life where I have had such issues.

Thankfully I'm not a big person and was able to squeeze into my seat without being too uncomfortable. When BA first started flying out of Austin, the food was great. Now, when I arrive at Heathrow, I get real food and take it on the plane with me. I don't know where or who makes BA's food, but it is not eatable. If BA did not have a direct flight from my hometown to London, I would fly with a different airline. When we checked into Heathrow, the line was extremely long and only one person was checking people in. It took nearly an hour to get to the counter. I understand airlines are making record profits and need to make up lost revenue from the pandemic, but I think BA has gone too far and has little concern for customer service in pursuit of profits.':\n",

      "Top features for class 'Not Verified |  I just want to warn everyone of the worst customer service experience ever! It really looks like British Airways customer service over the phone are trained to not help you in anyway and to create more problems rather than solving them. Last week we called British Airways to make a reservation for the family. At the time we explained to the customer service representative that we wanted to make a booking and then pay with a transfer of miles from American Express. The representative told us that he could not make the reservation until the miles were in the account, and asked us to contact American Express and make the transfer so that the booking could be made. The conversation was recorded by British Airways and could be checked. We immediately called AMEX (within 30 minutes) and solicited the transfer of 500K miles. AMEX clearly stated to us whether we were sure as the transfer was not reversible. We said that it was fine since we had checked previously with British Airways. We then called British Airways immediately to make our reservation to Miami. They confirmed that the miles arrived to our account, but to our surprise they told us that there was no space (not even one seat to Miami) and that we could not use the miles. We explained the situation and how we were led to believe that we could have a flight with miles if we transferred the miles, but all this went on deaf ears. We called the German office, which was absolutely unhelpful, so we also called UK customer service which was just as unhelpful. No manager was able to open a flight for us with miles and they just kept repeating that this was not possible (even though we if we paid for the flight and got the seats and also seats were available if we would have had gold status). In the end British Airways took absolutely no responsibility for causing the problem, did not give us a solution, kept our miles and we have to pay for a trip to Miami. With this service to their customers this is a company that should not be in business. Every time we call they made us wait for over 45 minutes then they answer and put us on hold, I have 2 days of waiting and talking with British Airways for over 2 hours each day, we were on the line for over 45 minutes each time. We were told by the lady agent to hang up the phone as I was too long on the phone and she had other customers? And we are not customers? They never help us.':\n",

      "Top features for class 'Not Verified |  I will never be flying with BA again. This is my first and last. I was flying from Singapore, transit at Sydney and then to Auckland, my destination. Firstly, there was an hour delay for the flight from Singapore. That was fine, I received an email in advance and could just head over slightly later. I confirmed with the staff at Singapore that I'll make it just fine for my connecting flight since it was just an hour delay vs a few hours in transit. I arrived in Sydney, the flight was fine and the BA staff were decent. I knew that it was close to my boarding time and so I rushed through the checks to get to my international transit flight.  We were ushered downstairs to catch the shuttle bus. After queuing for such a long time, they scanned my boarding pass and said that I was taken off this flight (I was not notified prior) and had to find the transfer desk and request for a re-book of my connecting flight. I rushed over as quickly as I could to waste no time. The lady who was a Qantas rep told me that I needed to speak to a Menzies rep about this matter. She gave me instructions to find a Menzies rep. I rushed to the boarding gate of an Asiana flight to speak to a Menzies rep but they were busy boarding the passengers. So, I waited by the side for all the passengers to board, only to be told to head to another transfer desk to re-book my connecting flight. There were other disgruntled passengers when I arrived. The next available flight was at night. This meant that I arrived at 8+am at Sydney and had to wait for close to 12 hours to get on the next flight. As I did not have an Aussie visa (did not need one as per my booked flights), I was not granted a day stay and was given a meal voucher and was sent off to hunt for a good place to rest/sleep/nap. Many cafes and restaurants rejected my meal voucher by the way but I finally got food. Ultimately, my re-booked flight was delayed again by another 30mins. The stress, anxiety, fatigue and hassle caused by BA's poor re-booking system. I've filed a formal complaint and request for compensation and we're waiting to hear back. ':\n",

We arrived in Dubai late and was informed the flight had gone. Emirates then informed me that I had to speak with Thai Air to get another flight issued. I spent over an hour phoning Thai Air with nobody picking up the phone. I then spoke with Thai Air Dubai who informed me that they did not have any alternative flights and suggested that I buy a new ticket and then claim the funds back later. I paid £1279.43 for a Kuwait Airways flight out of Dubai > Kuwaiti > Bangkok. Whilst in Dubai I checked with Kuwait Airlines regards my baggage and they informed me that it had not arrived from London and they would locate it and forward to my Bangkok address the following day. My baggage never arrived despite me completing lost baggage forms. I arrived back home yesterday and was informed by BA that they have found my bag in London. ':\n",

      "Top features for class 'Not Verified |  My itinerary was supposed to be Las Vegas-Chicago-London-Venice. When I landed in London Heathrow, I was stuck on the aircraft for 2 hours with no explanation as to why and because of such a delay I missed my connecting flight to Venice. Getting off the plane was when the real nightmare took place. Our flight had over 300 people aboard meaning many were in a rush to get to their flights or had already missed their flight. They put us into two lines, one of them being for people who missed their flight. I waited approximately 10 minutes just to come up to a clerk who told me \"Since I missed my flight I would have to go to the connecting flight BA service desks for further assistance.\" If I were to have known that was the only information I would receive I would have skipped being in that line altogether. When I went to the service desk where there were more than 60+ people standing in line, I waited 30+ minutes until a clerk came by passing everyone a pamphlet telling people to create an account online and to book our flights through the BA site since their systems were down and couldn't rebook anyone. It was a hassle doing anything through he BA site so I ended up calling the helpline. After waiting to be connected to a BA rep. I spoke with a woman who said I would have to call Iberia Airlines for a rebook, I called Iberia and they said since I booked through Expedia I would have to call them. Expedia then said I would have to call BA for the rebook so when I called BA again, the rep. said the only flight he could get me booked for was for the following Monday, mind you I was travelling since the 25th which was a Friday. All the hotels in the vicinity of the airport were booked, I was trying to figure out where my checked baggage went (I still don't have it), most of the customer service I got from BA reps was horrible service as if they could care less for the predicament their company caused me. They acted like I was inconveniencing them with \"my issues\". I also had to sleep in the airport waiting for my flight the next morning because hotels were booked. Overall my experience with British Airlines has been the worst airline experience I've ever had to deal with. I will never book with this company again.

I had to call BA a few times regarding both my outbound and return flight and I would rate their customer service 10/10. Everyone I talked to was extremely friendly and helpful, one employee even tried to help me figure out the recently updated arrival regulations from an Italian website and listened to my rant about constantly changing restrictions and quarantines. I was refunded promptly for part of my flight that had been cancelled and I was able to change my return flight to a completely different route and date with only a minimal charge. They have really shown flexibility here, which is needed when travelling in 2020. The flight itself was fine and I appreciate that food and drink options are currently a bit limited, given that everyone should wear their mask as much as possible rather than sipping tea. The one thing - which I mean as constructive criticism though - I think BA could improve is a little more exchange with their destination airports. The arrival sheets for Italy we were given on the flight were outdated and the ground staff in Heathrow in charge of the boarding procedure did not even know that swab tests were now mandatory for arrivals in Italy when I asked him whether he knew any details of what to expect in Venice. That's fine on the first day after (yet another) update, but this rule had been in place for 4 days on the day I travelled. Overall my experience with BA was very positive though and I am happy to spend a little more on my flight than I would with some cheaper airlines for the great customer service I received.':\n",

      "Top features for class 'Not Verified |  Quite possibly the worst business class I have ever flown in.  It barely rates as premium economy, and BA shouldn't be suggesting that they are offering premium seating on regional routes in Europe. On these routes, BA has crammed their seats so close together that the experience is like flying on a discount airline. Buyer beware, there is no point in upgrading to business class, other than ensuring the middle seat is empty and you and your bag can board first. The seats are extremely uncomfortable, and they can't really be reclined. There is no in flight entertainment; not even an app (which many discount airlines do use for regional flights). Once upon a time BA used to be a good airline, and maybe it still is for long-haul, but it's truly awful for short-haul (and is a five-hour flight actually short haul?). Might as well save some money and just book a cheaper airline. Staff are courteous and professional; the issue is the quality of the product for the price.':\n",

I call them and speak to a gentleman who continuously spoke over me and would not listen to my concerns and eventually I give up and want to book a new flight, obviously at a much higher price but using the voucher I didn’t want. However to my surprise I am unable to use this voucher because they can’t tell me what it is until I receive it at a point in the future that they can’t say when. So they now have my money and I have to re-book at full cost. In the end in order to get me off the phone they hung up.':\n",

      "Top features for class 'Not Verified |  Today, my husband and a friend flew from Dublin to London City Airport. All apparently went well from check-in through the flight. After that, the ineptitude and lack of systems seemed to be in full bloom. We waited and waited for our bags to come off the baggage carriage, but neither my husband's nor mine came. I found a BA service person to \"help\" me. He told me that there were 60 bags checked and 59 on the plane.  I thought, one of our bags made it. Then, two other customers from the same flight were complaining to someone else that they, too, had not gotten their bags. So, I assumed the 59 out of 60 was some kind of interesting fiction. I was then told to file a claim on BA.com which we did. At this time, about 10 hours after our flight landed, the system says they have no idea where our bags are! Now, I've had bags not get on flights before - less and less as airlines have tracked their bags fastidiously (I usually fly United Airlines which tracks your bag at every stage of the flight with updated info - e.g., \"Your bag was loaded onto the plane\"; \"Your bag is on its way to baggage claim\"). BA doesn't seem to have anything like this. In this case, again, it appears BA cannot even locate the bag. I hadn't flown BA in many years and with experience I would never book them again.':\n",

      "Top features for class 'Not Verified |  Very poor flight from Cape Town to London. After the chaos of Cape Town Airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to get through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight. Boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne. The captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time would be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this would mean our arrival would be too early to land due to the 6.00 am lifting of the overnight jet ban at Heathrow so we would have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so. This was no big deal. Then the captain announced that due to IT issues at Heathrow they could get not compile necessary paperwork so we would be delayed for an indefinite period. With the delay of uncertain duration one might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for Business Class but this was not forthcoming. In the event take off was permitted quite soon after. The crew had distributed menus but then did a PA to say that there were changes to each of the main courses. A drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks, for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner. Drinks and nuts were served circa 45 minutes after take off, in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husband had another half glass of champagne. Dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler. The food looked bland, unappetising and tasted the more so. The cheese (two small pieces) were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney. No top up of the wine was offered (we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised basis) and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence. The flight was some 11 hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake. Breakfast was slightly more edible than dinner. Coffee or tea were offered by individual mug, orange juice was available on request. Cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests for individual items. Come on British Airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routes. For the cost of a business class ticket passengers are enjoying only additional space and seat comfort (flatbed) as a benefit over an economy ticket at or below 25% of the price paid for the premium cabin. Time was when flying in Business Class was real treat, no longer is this the case.':\n",

      "Top features for class 'Not Verified |  We are on our way home after a 3 week holiday in the UK and have had all 4 flights with British Airways. Our 2 internal flights between London and Edinburgh were great due to the friendly staff and there were no complications, however, the 2 long haul flights have been a nightmare. Our initial flight from Cape Town to Heathrow was a full flight, the staff seemed very overwhelmed, they ran out of certain food and drinks and as we were in economy right at the back we got the \"leftovers\", my entertainment system was also not working. We are about to board the return flight from Heathrow to Cape Town and the check in process was horrific. I had booked through Expedia and somehow my return flight did not have a checked in bag allowance which I didn't realise until we checked in. I ended up having to pay an additional £85 for my bag, after being told to try do it under manage my booking on the app which was not possible and I also spent 20 minutes on hold trying to get through to the BA customer service number with no luck. We asked to speak to someone is person in terminal 5 and were told that they have no customer service desk in the main BA terminal.  Overall it took us about 2 hours to get me checked in after speaking to about 6 different staff members, none of which could help me. There was also a discrepancy with the baggage allowance as my friend I am traveling with was allowed 26kg and after paying to add my bag I was told it was overweight as I was only allowed 23kg and the bag was 24kg.

      "Top features for class 'Not Verified |  We had a Premium Economy return flight Los Angeles to London. The outbound flight was cancelled with under 12 hours notice, and we had to instead take an economy flight via Dublin to London. That's annoying but it happens. What is really difficult to understand is BA's response since I raised this as a claim once our return flight had completed (as I was instructed to do). It is now nearly 5 months and there has been no response other than one in early March with the title \"we've not forgotten your case\" and \"We're really sorry you're still waiting for a response from us. We know it's been a long time since you contacted us and this isn't the service you should expect. Rest assured we've not forgotten your case. Our Customer Relations team are working extremely hard to respond to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your continued patience. You can check the status of your case here. Please accept our most sincere apologies. We look forward to speaking with you soon.\" I called about a month ago to enquire and was told i'd be hearing within the week. This is just extremely poor customer service, in addition to the inconvenience and stress of the late-cancelled flight, delays and change in class of flight. British Airways really seems to be on the decline, i have so many friends who are long-time customers like us who are having flights cancelled or delayed with little commitment to make it right.

The whole pre-flight experience now is prehistoric, they appear to have gone back to the 80’s and now make passengers physically queue to manually check in adding hours to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people together in a big slow queue. On the premise it’s due to covid precautions! They are the only airline making passengers do this and they can’t even open all the desks so for 200 passengers they had two check in staff, like the post office in 1980! Apart from the aircraft and cabin crew literally everything else about this airline has disintegrated to the point where they’re just not reliable enough to use for business purposes and their attitude towards exec club members and other loyal customers is a disgrace. I’ve chosen and insisted upon BA for business and personal travel for decades and accumulated a lot of air miles, I also have not one but two BA Amex companion vouchers that cost me 40k of spending to earn so that tells you how much I’ve supported this airline despite their shocking decline in recent years. In the last year I’ve booked 6 BA flights, 1 personal and 5 business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my money and wasting my time planning the itineraries, 5 of the 6 have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines, the personal one to St Lucia they cancelled my return 2 days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly back immediately or risk being stuck there for 6 weeks. That cost me my £2500 holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation! A couple of weeks ago I noticed that one of my Amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on Nov 12th this year so I tried to speak to them. As the World has largely been closed since March 20 I assumed it would be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destinations properly open, not to mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday, but after 2 days going around in circles speaking really bad English to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country I finally got through to someone at BA who told me that no they won’t extend the voucher! I’m even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect I will not spend another penny with this airline, I’m not even going to bother using my second voucher and I’ve cancelled my BA Amex. I work in the music business managing tours for bands so I reckon I book 1000 flights a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude has cost them that! Roll on the inevitable BA administration but at least somebody else can buy it for cheap and start rebuilding what was once the Worlds Favourite Airline but now the most ridiculed. Who’d have thought BA could ever make Ryanair look like an attractive option.':\n",

There was no information of the whereabouts of my bag and after searching for someone for about 30 minutes, I found the point of contact and she told me my bag was left behind. I gave her my details of where I would be staying and she told me that they would contact me. After a few days and still no contact I tried to call British Airways customer service. The woman at the airport didn’t give me a file reference number, so it was quite difficult to try and locate my bag, but they finally found the reference number and my bag and said it would be delivered in a couple of days. I told them that I had switched hotels and gave them the address for where I was staying and everything was fine. But then a couple of weeks went by and my bag was still nowhere to be seen and it was time for me to fly home. At the airport I tried to talk with the personnel there to try and locate my bag and they said that it was delivered to the first hotel I stayed at, even though I had given them an updated address. I asked them what I should to since I was flying home now. The guy at the counter told me that it wasn’t his problem and that I should figure it out myself. I questioned him about his response and he just walked away. A manager saw that and came up to me and apologized for his colleague and that they would send someone to fetch my bag and send it with either my flight or the next one. I came home and a couple of days later I received my bag. I made a complaint and claims on British Airways website since I had to buy clothes and toiletries during my vacation because I didn’t have my bag. In January they said that they would refund me for my claims, it is now April (almost May) and I have still not received the refund even after multiple email conversations.

      "Top features for class 'Not Verified | I was excited to fly BA as I'd not travelled with them long haul for over 25yrs. I've travelled to Australia on many occasions, so I've pretty much travelled with them all. Terrible was my experience. BA have become the Ryanair of long-haul travel, riding on their previous good name and reputation. We were delayed for 5hrs at the terminal, where we were offered one glass of water and then at the last minute our meal - with no additional drinks offered. The charging points were outdated and 3 out of 5 didn't work (family of five travelling). The in flight entertainment was also outdated and the movies available were poor compared to other airlines. The food was atrocious - we flew BA LHR-HongKong and return and Cathay HK-Australia return and the comparison was vast. We were offered pre meal drinks and snacks, drinks with our meal, a menu for our flights so we knew our choices, the quality of the food was vastly better with Cathay. Our luggage was lost for nearly two hours in Hong Kong and when we arrived into London, one of our bags was so badly damaged it was unusable. The only redeeming part was the crew on our return flight were amazing. Severine was an angel and helped make the journey more pleasant for my kids.':\n",

My flight layover in London was 1hr5min. British Airways promised that the arriving and departing terminals in London were the same, but that was a total lie. My wife and I were sprinting across the airport, but between getting off the aeroplane, having to go through security again, and having to get to the other side of the airport for our connection, we missed the layover flight. We had the same route in the reverse direction. I called BA hoping to change the return flights and explained this situation. They kept insisting that since the layover was a staggering 5 minutes more than London’s minimum 1hr layover threshold that they were unable to help in any way. British Airways has by far the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Ryanair which is a no-frills airline has better customer service and that is saying something. I will never be flying BA again and plan on converting my company away from BA flights as well. Be warned.

      "Top features for class 'Not Verified | Jan 30th, I booked a last-minute, transatlantic flight to Ireland to attend a funeral for a close friend of mine. So, the nature of the trip was bad enough as it was. It was not a vacation for me. On the transatlantic leg of the flight, BA was the airline. It was a terrible experience. A baby was crying right next to me for a good portion of the flight. That’s not BA’s fault, but just to continue to set the stage. Mid-flight they had to close both the bathrooms in the middle of the plane. I was in seat 16J, right behind one of the bathrooms. They both started leaking sewage into the passenger compartment. I could see the water coming toward me and soon it was under my feet. As you can imagine, it didn’t smell great. It made a bad trip worse and got all over a new pair of boots. I contacted BA about this and explained in great detail what had happened. Their response was essentially, “Sorry about that”. I contacted them again to verify that this was the formal response. They responded by offering me a 50 euro voucher to use on a future BA flight, which has very little value to me, if any. I contacted them again, giving them another chance to make it right. Nothing. It’s not their fault that there was a screaming baby, nor is it their fault that the restrooms overflowed, created a disgusting mess, and soiled my boots. It is their fault that they made no effort to make it right. This is not just an inconvenience. It's a health and safety issue. As far as I can tell, I’m the only one who got sewage under my feet. I think this is completely unacceptable and will do everything I can to avoid flying BA in the future.':\n",

      "Top features for class 'Not Verified | Paid a quick visit to Nice yesterday from Heathrow. Decided to go Business class since my last short haul flight in Economy was a real crush and rather unpleasant. I paid over £300 for a business class round trip. I went into the to BA lounge in Terminal 5 which was very crowded. Being 6.30 in the morning I decided against having a drink and stuck to the breakfast offering. The cooked options did not look that appealing but the fresh fruit selection was very enjoyable. We subsequently discovered a much nicer BA lounge closer to the gate, B36, and waited there for 40 mins. Boarding was efficient and we got ourselves seated in 2A and 2C, seat 2B was blocked out, which acted as an additional table. There did not seem to be any difference in the width of the seat from the cramped seating in Economy but there may have been an additional inch of leg room. I think that BA are trying to outdo EasyJet in terms on no frills. It would not cost BA that much to supply Business class passengers with a complimentary newspaper to read during the flight. The inflight magazine is no longer available. There are no screens so there was zero in terms of in flight entertainment. The inflight WiFi was flaky at best and non-existent at other times.

      "Top features for class 'Not Verified | Regarding the aircraft and seat: The business class seats on this flight were pretty good. All were of the suite type, where every seat has its own booth with sliding door for extra privacy. The downside to this is that if you are travelling as a couple, its quite difficult to interact. There is ample storage and USB charging ports. The seat is pretty comfortable. As someone who finds it very difficult to sleep on flights, this was one of the only times I've been able to get a few minutes sleep here and there. The amenities provided are pretty average when compared to other airlines. The leather toiletry bag was quite nice though. No slippers, only a pair of socks. The restrooms on the flight are very small, and don't provide much in the way of toiletries compared to other airlines. No free Wi-Fi in Business Class is not acceptable. Another example of BA's penny pinching in recent years. Regarding the staff and customer service: Poor. Inattentive. Beyond meal times there was offer of water during the flight. I had to go and find an attendant and ask. There was also no offer of any snacks. Rude at times. My partner asked for a fork to be replaced as the one provided was quite clearly dirty. The attendant was incredibly rude in response. This left us shocked. Different customers seem to receive a different quality of service. A customer behind me was repeatedly greeted politely by name and asked how they were, whether they needed anything etc. whereas my partner and I were not afforded the same level of personal service. This is disappointing as we paid the same price for the tickets so expect the same level of service. The food was pretty bad. I had risotto while my partner had chicken. Both were extremely over cooked and the rice looked like porridge. The vegetables were discoloured and flavourless. The bread was nice though. The breakfast wasn't much better. Summary: BA has become the Ryanair of long haul. The customer service is way below what I would expect for a premium airline in a premium seat. You pay a premium price for a very average service. If there are other options available I would choose them over BA these days.':\n",

Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated (probably from chilled) so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid. One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal. Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy, economy plus and first on a long haul flight? My advice if GF - take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours. My travelling companion had very good regular meals, or so they told me, with a choice of main course on the same flights. Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging. Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered.':\n",

      "Top features for class 'Not Verified | Top Ten REASONS to not use British Airways To all: Be Aware and be on Notice- Travel at your own risk I have travelled for years on many different airlines, and I have to say that British Airways ranks as one of the top two most horrible airlines to fly. Don’t waste your time or money. Customer service is non-existent. Please be on notice that if you purchase a ticket from them and once, they have your money, you can kiss any customer service and or help resolving your issue goodbye. We used them to travel to Europe and it was the worst experience I have had with an airline in years. When you work hard and save your money to travel, you expect a good experience. Welp not with this company. Who I am sure, makes millions on customers per year. I understand that sometimes things happen, but this started right after we booked our flight AND THE BAD EXPERIENCE DID NOT END UNTIL WE SET FOOT BACK TO OUR HOMETOWN. Please take note: #1 - The customer service number is buried on the internet and not listed on their website. I had to google it and still got the run around when someone finally answered. Trust me, the number is a secret. #2 – When you FINALLY find a customer service number, there is a long wait and when or if someone answers, they will not resolve your issues. Instead, they pass the buck to whatever airlines that they sold your ticket to. NO ONE TAKES OWNERSHIP #4- What airlines operates 365 days a year and around the clock but doesn’t have customer service reps to help you, the customer? BRITISH AIRWAYS that’s who. #5 - They will cancel your flight without notice and not notify you, AT ALL. NO EMAIL, NO TEXT. #6- If you are not the primary on your ticket you will get no notifications or even if you are the primary, you may or may not get notifications. #7 - If you pay for seats and you pick them, it doesn’t matter, they will cancel your seats and not refund your money and then play stupid. #8 - The flight may be cheaper, but it is not once you are done paying for seats. #9- They will route to another partner airline and not notify you #10 – If you have a connecting flight, they will cancel one leg and not the other and NOT NOTIFY YOU. I will never use them again. And if this review helps one person that heeds my advice, then my job is done.':\n",

      "Top features for class 'Not Verified | We have had some torrid experiences with BA - which we have not been shy to report. So when we flew yesterday with them from Heathrow to Austin and had a great flight in every way, it felt right to feedback on that. The staff in the upstairs business class cabin were, frankly, wonderful. Cheerful, efficient and calm. What more could you ask? The food was pretty nice and the champagne lovely. The beds were very comfortable and sleeping was easy. I literally cannot think of any real negatives. The luggage lockers were quite small but then it’s an older model of the plane so that probably explains it. If only BA could deliver this kind of experience on every occasion, they would once again be the “world’s favourite airline’. Sadly, the current CEO doesn’t seem able to inspire and motivate his staff to be consistently delightful. Perhaps once he moves on we can expect something better. Although the flight was a bit delayed on departure it arrives bang on time. As we entered the (literally empty) immigration area, we were met by the most charming customs officer you can imagine, who ended up giving us tourist tips and ideas for bars! Surreal, as anyone who regularly travels to the States, will testify! It felt as if we were living in the Truman Show at one point but in the nicest possible way.

My first flight was delayed by several hours, causing me to miss my connection at London Heathrow. Upon arriving at the airport after midnight, I was given a hotel voucher. However, the hotel designated by BA rudely denied me check-in, claiming it was fully booked. I had to return to Heathrow at 1 AM and found a different hotel, paying for the taxi out of my own pocket. As a result of these complications, I arrived in São Paulo more than 24 hours late. Despite my efforts to assert my rights and seek reimbursement for the taxi, BA's customer service has been extremely poor. Their phone lines are non-functional, emails are only answered automatically, and the appropriate channels for such requests have not been responsive since the first week of March.

It was a 787–8 series aircraft. The flight attendant specifically mentioned it was eight years old as he recalled flying it when it was brand new. The business class seats were abysmal. My seat was at the window facing backwards. With the divider down, which had to be in that position for boarding, taxi, takeoff and landing, I was literally just a few feet away from the person in the aisle seat who was facing forward, We both couldn’t help but stare at one another. It couldn’t be avoided. It was horrible. The service wasn’t all that good either. The flight attendant did a pre-dinner drink. When she came back to ask for my choice for dinner, she said none of my selection were left. I was a little upset as nothing else appealed to me. She then came back later, and said the other part of the aircraft had more of the meal selection I wanted. I’m not sure why they didn’t coordinate that to begin with. I was NOT offered any wine or other drink with with dinner. The meal was put down in front of me and the flight attendant never came back other than to clear the tray. Overall, this flight was not very good. I flew over on American and back on BA and paid $6000 round-trip. I’d fly American again. My preferred carrier is United or Lufthansa.

The lounge at Gatwick was clean and modern and made for a nice relaxing start to the journey. Boarding was quick and the flight departed on-time and landed 10 minutes early, the crew were very attentive and friendly. The in-flight meal was delicious (I had smoked Salmon served with curried rice). Overall a really lovely flying experience.

      "Our flight out to Dubrovnik was at the painful time of 6:30 in the morning and from London Gatwick, not an easy airport to get to at that hour especially as you have to be at the airport minimum 2hrs before to be ready to board. I understand why the likes of easyJet, Ryanair or Wizzair fly at very odd times to utilise cheaper slots at airports, but it seems an odd choice for BA given most people like us who fly with them choose them based on quality not on price alone. Outbound LGW-DBV: Boarding was fairly quick, easy and efficient and we took off on time. Pilot announcements clear, professional and inspired confidence which is something I appreciate and expect of BA pilots. Aircraft was clean and it had not been through the recent refurbishment program yet so had the advantage of having the 'Pinnacle' seats in economy still with more padding and adjustable winged headrests for better comfort. Complimentary Harrogate Mineral water given as usual which is a premium touch, complimentary snack of a Nutrigain bar was poor and not premium however. Cabin crew felt very unpolished in both presentation and behaviour - messy ill-fitting uniforms and unclassy make-up. Toilets clean and maintained, appreciate anti-bacterial wipes being kept available post-covid. Inbound DBV-LGW: For some reason no online or app check-in available, despite Dubrovnik Airport being a very modern airport with state of the art facilities. No queue at manual check-in though, and ground staff were very warm, friendly and helpful. Pro-actively offered to take our larger hand-luggage into hold free of charge, but we decided to keep with us as we would have to dash for train home from airport and trains on the other end were being cancelled already. We did not understand the delay to our flight as the inbound flight for that day had took off on time and landed on time. Also we travelled to Dubrovnik out of season, and the airport was empty at that hour, with all services being available solely for this flight taking off that evening. All the passengers in the terminal at that time including us were there to take this flight. We boarded on time and then we all sat at the gate for 15 minutes for no reason. It's truly bizarre how BA managed to take off late when all the services at the airport were operating and live solely for the purpose of enabling this flight to take off. Pilots for this flight were unpolished, with unclear announcements - during the flight one couldn't even remember where we flying back to! No apology for delay. Cabin crew a bit smarter presented and seemed more approachable. Harrogate water given out and the worlds tiniest bag of pretzels complimentary. Seats for this flight were horrendous and the new 'slimline' ones BA are installing from row 14 onwards. These seats have barely any padding, so very hard and also have no headrests so very hard to get comfortable. We landed 55 minutes late in Gatwick and again no apology was given - we were lucky to catch the last uncanceled train home otherwise we'd been stranded for hours. We'd spent half an hour circling Gatwick because we missed our original landing slot. Given 7 because in the context of the short-haul market thats what they deserve - we fly BA as we don't fly the low-cost carriers after so many bad experiences, but it's by no measure good, just the least bad option. Given 1 point extra solely for giving something complimentary onboard.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |   I am a frequent flyer with BA and have been for the last 15 years. Having noted the ratings given, frankly, I cannot understand how BA scores three stars for most aspects of its service. In a nutshell, BA has placed profit margins over passenger appreciation. This fact was hammered home on my return leg, which was not in Club Europe. Quite alarmingly, BA appears to place profit over passenger safety by extending its \"Business Class\" seating up to and beyond emergency exit rows and then failing to ensure those seated in exit rows have the physical capacity to actually open the door incase of an emergency. I was not at all reassured to see an elderly and slightly built woman seated with the responsibility of opening the overwing exit should the need have arisen. Short-haul business (Club Europe) is simply a joke and only useful for gaining valuable tier points for lounge/pre-boarding benefits. While cabin crew service is excellent, the lack of space and reduction in refreshment choices, etc. places them a million 'air'miles behind competing airlines, such as Qatar, Turkish or Emirates who understand the true definition of customer appreciation and hospitality. BA has consistently eroded the value of their Executive Club and seems to be of the impression that recent changes in obtaining avios points during the booking process benefit passengers - really? I want to support BA and did enjoy flying with them up to the point when they started penny pinching and became more deserving of the name \"Budget Airways\" The attached photos taking during my most recent itinerary highlight the difference in customer care/appreciation between British Airways and another airline used in this trip.

But there were no other seats available. We got to Heathrow about 6 hours before departure and tried to change seats at check-in, to no avail, although the lady was very sympathetic and tried her utmost. She did offer us an upgrade to Premium Economy but at 450GBP each it was beyond our affordability. She said we should try again at the departure gate but that also failed. We spoke to a member of the flight crew who was totally unsympathetic. The economy seats are so tiny that I was jammed shoulder to shoulder between by wife and a stranger, with knees touching the seat pocket in front. For 12 hours we suffered. When we did manage to get out of our seat due to the kindness of the young lady next to me on the aisle, it was a mission trying to clamber past the reclined backrest in front of me. BA Economy is absolutely awful. The evening meal was near-inedible - both choices were spicy foods which are not very suitable when flying, especially for an older person.

I booked a ticket from Expedia for a British Airways Operated flight from Madrid to Belfast with a changeover at London Heathrow. The whole itinerary was listed as BA although the Madrid to London flight was Iberia. On Jan 22nd, London was experiencing cold and fog. The Iberian flight sat on the tarmac for 2 hours in Madrid because of the London weather. Upon landing in Terminal 3, I had to take a bus to Terminal 5. The flight was the last flight to Belfast for the evening and it had already taken off. The BA desk was swamped with people as many people had to spend the night due to the weather. The British Airways staff said that we could go book any hotel up to 200 pounds and we would be reimbursed. I was barely able to find a room and had to take an expensive cab. However when trying to get the reimbursement, BA said it wasn't their problem and that it was Iberia's problem. Iberia said they do not reimburse due to the weather. When complaining to BA, they said they only market the flight as BA and that they refuse to reimburse. Absolutely disgusting behavior by the airline to not take any responsibility for a flight that they were using their name to sell it to people but don't want to take responsibility for it. Did they expect me to take the bus back to Terminal 3? Their people gave out false information.':\n",

Flight boarded at 1835 for a 1900 departure. 45 mins later, 4 late customers were allowed to board, and not a single PA or apology from the flight deck or crew. The benefit of low cost airlines is they they don't hang around for latecomers, sadly BA is in a time warp over this. BA pilots used to be some of the best for updating status, but this has dropped dramatically in the last 2-3 years. The food standards and choices in the T5 First Lounge are one of the items that have been improved post Covid. Inflight service on this short 2h 40m flight was a light dinner tray, only 2 choices by row 3 - with 32 passengers in Club Europe only 4 salad options were available. No printed menu offered and the cabin staff explained he had only been given 10 menus for 32 customers. It appears there is no supply control in place at BA. Food quality was okay, but while Do&Co supply this, the Do&Co meals on Turkish Airlines remain superior to what BA manages (I flew Turkish 10 days ago).

Sat in row 7 outbound, 2 rows behind Club Europe. Sat in row 25 on the return, leg room seemed tighter than row 7. The brown leather seating suggested that the aircraft may have been in the BMI Fleet. Didn’t bother with the new M&S On Board service outward, but did on the return. The M&S sandwich was everything you would expect from an M&S sandwich (apart from the cost), but the coffee I had and the tea my wife had were below standard. It also took the 2 cabin crew the best part of 75 minutes to get from row 6 to row 25. The other 2 members of the cabin crew appeared to hide in Club Europe attending to just 10 passengers. Despite quite a lot of turbulence and the Seat Belt sign on for about 30 minutes, they continued to serve hot drinks and passengers were advised to be careful.

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  BA created a new low-cost subsidiary in BA Euroflyer for flights out of London Gatwick. From a passenger point of view this is meant to mean no difference in service from BA mainline short-haul out of Heathrow. However it is most definitely inferior. Firstly is the seats - BA promised to keep their old much more comfortable Pinnacle seats up to row 12 in their refurbishment of these planes with slimline seats, however at BA Euroflyer it seems the whole plane has these installed on some planes. Despite snagging a seat in row 10, we ended up still with those horrible back breaking seats that have no lumbar support and no headrests. One positive of the new seats was meant to be at-seat power to charge devices, but this didn't have that either. The onboard service is meant to include some complimentary food and drink, namely a sweet or savoury snack and a small bottle of Harrogate Spa water. What we got was horrible Nairn's Raisin Oat biscuits, without asking if we'd like the other choice and no water. On the return flight it was explicitly announced we'd be offered a glass of water for free, but this was not offered during the service. The snack was sole choice of a pack of McVities Milk Chocolate digestive, hardly premium and downgrade from some of the more alternative and upmarket offerings we've received when flying from Heathrow. On the way back we did have non-refurbished plane with pinnacle seats, this was welcome, however clearly the plane is not maintained, as one toilet had no water flowing from the tap - very irritating when you soap up to wash your hands after going to the toilet. I went to rinse my hand in the other toilet, luckily it wasn't busy, the tap was working but the sink wasn't draining and almost overflowed. Lastly the cabin crew on BA Euroflyer are very unpolished, look miserable and extremely demotivated. A lot of them a very young, we're talking late teens and clearly very inexperienced and not likely to stay long under the conditions offered to them. BA really needs to rethink its product offering in short-haul - ultimately people choose to fly with them for variety of reasons, but invariably there is a reason like us they don't fly with their low-cost rivals because they want peace of mind, less stress and to be comfortable. So replicating the likes of Ryanair, easyJet or Wizz Air is just alienating as a customer, because we choose BA to avoid the kind of experience they offer. We were on an award ticket, but looking at cash tickets they're not even cheap nor offer better timings than those rivals, despite all this bean-counting!':\n",

The lounge at CPT was also bursting at the seams and food orders were so behind that many passengers had left by the time their food arrived. On boarding, we were surprised to find that the menu, amenity kit and bottle of water had already been placed in the storage drawer. We suspect this is another cynical time-saving initiative on the part of BA. Frustratingly, the menu turned out to be incorrect and the replacement dishes were probably the worst we have ever encountered in any business class on any airline. The drinks run was cancelled without any warning on the spurious basis of a passenger with a nut allergy. It's hard to avoid suspicions that cabin crew were being economical with the truth.

There is a good array of salads, pasta, bread, and hot food available. The festive Turkey and Ham pie was particularly good. The flight was delayed as LHR was very busy on a Tuesday evening.

The bar service was good but it seems that BA have done away with champagne on-board and also in the lounge. A menu is handed out prior to departure with a good food offering for the length of flight. The food was very good, with beef cheek served with vegetables being chosen. BA have always excelled with their catering and this has not changed. The seat is a standard economy seat, with a table in the middle seat for Club Europe, a standard practice for BA. The seat was comfortable, but with limited leg room. The cabin was clean, presentable, and tidy with no issues.

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways has a total lack of respect for its customers. I was booked to fly from Frankfurt Main to London City Airport, and just a couple of hours before the scheduled departure the flight was suddenly cancelled by BA without explanation, when I was already at the airport. The worst thing was the utter callousness that staff showed towards customers. The ground staff’s attitude was that they are merely third party agents, not BA employees, and therefore they quickly washed their hands of us all, telling us we had to contact BA directly via phone if we wanted help. They couldn’t even provide us a phone number, telling us to look it up on ba.com ! So BA abandoned its passengers. They did tell us that the BA departure to Heathrow had also been cancelled, meaning there would be no further BA flight from Frankfurt to London that day (although other airlines were still operating the route- but BA refused to rebook us on them). The reason given for both cancellations was “technical reasons”. No assistance or information was provided on our rights due to cancellation, nor any information on help regarding food/ accommodation help etc. Their attitude was literally that the cancellation had nothing to do with them and it was our problem, not theirs. I received an email an hour later notifying me that I had been automatically rebooked on an alternative flight 24 hours later, which wasn’t acceptable as I had to get back to London that night. I rang BA’s call centre and again, they showed a high degree of callousness. 95% of the half-hour call was spent with me waiting on hold, with the phone just cutting off after half an hour, and no meaningful information given to me by that point. There was no attempt by the call operator to call me back when the line cut (and I had a solid phone signal and wifi as I was still standing in Terminal 2 of Frankfurt Main airport), even though my phone number is listed in my booking contact details. They just don’t care. In the end I had to arrange my own return to London by taking a coach to Hanh airport which was 112km away , waiting there for 5 hours and then booking an expensive last minute ticket with Ryanair to Stansted. At least that flight operated on time and got me back to London! BA is worse than a low cost carrier now.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  British Airways oversold my LHR to LAX flight; I booked months in advance paid in full and actually paid over $1000 extra to fly their Airbus A380. Tried to check in online day before flight, got unknown system error couldn’t check in. Arrived at LHR 3.5 hours early; none of BA kiosks worked, all manual check in by understaffed BA staff who were all unhelpful. Insane queue times; lots of other frustrated passengers in line. Denied boarding at the gate because flight oversold, no explanations, no apologies, constantly ignored by BA staff who don’t have the patience to listen to your situation or be helpful. Finally gate manager books alternate flight to Paris CDG, supposedly to connect with an Air France flight. We get to CDG only to be told by Air France their flight was full; no idea why BA manager bumped me to AF flight that’s also full! That’s insult to injury to be bumped twice! Went to BA desk at CDG, no help at all they told us to call BA and couldn’t even provide the phone number; just told us to look online. On top of all that my luggage is lost somewhere between BA and AF in Paris CDG. I’m an American citizen and speak perfect English, but I feel completely humiliated and treated like second class citizen by multiple BA staff through the whole ordeal. Mostly they just ignore you or bounce you from one counter to another without even trying to listen to your problem. Zero accountability. Will never ever fly BA again! Absolute worst travel experience of my life.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  Check in was chaotic and badly organised. Even though there were two desks, one for premium and one economy, there ended up being just one queue, in front of the premium check in, even though most passengers in it were economy. That meant that those travelling in club or with higher status had no separate queue to join. Whilst I was waiting in line another passenger went up to query and we ended up forming a new line in front of the economy check in desk for premium passengers, unnecessarily badly organised, the staff in charge should be retrained! Security at the airport was very quick and through to the lounge. This is a generic airport lounge for all airlines, and it is actually quite good overall. Nice layout and seating options, reasonable food and drink options, and an outdoor terrace which is really nice. Boarding was very well organised, although quite slow to get everyone on board.. but the flight was probably only half full and we still departed early so I think they felt no rush.. and it actually made the boarding experience nicer and more relaxed. On board the club Europe seats are fine by European business standards, although as previously commented are really not very good overall.. the meal service was disappointing. As is normal, BA do not stock enough of the proper meal option .. when the options are so limited and varied in quality BA really should stock enough for everyone to have the good meal. Sadly they had run out by the time they got to me so I had the option of vegetarian sausage or a salad. I wanted a hot meal so went for the sausage and I can honestly say it was one of the most disgusting onboard meals I’ve ever had in any cabin class, rolling some mush (similar consistency to mashed potato) into a sausage shape does not make it a sausage! BA you need to improve the meal options, make the vegetarian meal something you specifically have to request in advance and offer all passengers a choice of two decent meals .. then people will not be left with such a substandard alternative when their first choice runs out! Whilst I hadn’t planned on using it, the on board WiFi was not functioning so was not available to use. Overall though the flight was fairly comfortable and the cabin crew were very friendly and efficient. I used avios to pay for the flight so it was obviously good value for money for me!':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  Extremely disappointed In trip experience. I am Gold MVP 100,000+ miler with Alaska Airlines. My ticket and travel wasnt linked with Alaska Airlines. When speaking with Alaska representative, they confirmed it was due to lack of effort on British Airways In accomplishing this task. I could over look the lack of effort on this even though frustrating. The Main issue is the ticketing and Flt connection process.  I departed Egypt this morning with connecting tickets in hand. Once I arrived in USA apparently my Alaska (AS 2449) flt was changed to a 5 hour later flight with a completely different airline (Delta). Who does that without notifying the customer. I found this out when trying to go through security In Seattle, they said my ticket was not valid. I had to go to Alaska Airline to find out What the issue was. They explained British Airways had rebooked with Delta. This took about 30mins with customer Service. Then i had to go to Delta to sort the mess out. I am so frustrated.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  Flew ATL to LHR 8th Jan 2023. Was unlucky enough to be on board a 23 year old 777. Refit gave it a decent IFE screen and the seat looked decent. Although combine the IFE with the cheap and nasty earbuds, and any movie can be ruined. Headrest was great, just a pity little padding is used on the seat as my Wife and I were very uncomfortable. The leg room in general is poor, especially when passengers keep their seat reclined from start to finish. Zero room. Aircraft was tired. Rubber spacers falling out, silicone sealer falling apart in the toilets. Toilet seats old, stained. Rubber on arm rest was hanging off. No post take off drinks/snacks offered.  Meal was sent out after a couple of hours. Was poor. Chicken cubes that reminded me of dog food, mashed potatoes that were purified within an inch of their life. Stale rock hard roll, salad which was rice and carrots?! Dried crackers with no cheese. Kids meal was just as sad. Tiny leaf salad with enough dressing to refloat a shipwreck. Coffee creamer was given with the kids meal? Snack was decent for the adults, bagel with cheese and egg. Hot and tasty. Kids snack was a green wrap with spinach and onions in it.  Very very poor. Mix the food, BA service with a grunt, being crammed into a seat for 7 hours, landing at a remote stand and enduring a bus to the terminal and BA in my opinion, is terrible. This flight was so disappointing. Other than one great member of cabin crew, everything else was just average.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Club Europe London - Tenerife South 5 November and returned 12 November. Club Europe seats are not comfortable - you pay a lot more for exactly the same leg room but have the middle seat of 3 empty to spread out a tiny bit. For the fare I would hope for at least a couple more inches of leg room - it would make a huge difference. We did at least get a meal (outbound cottage pie and inbound sausage and mash) which were not too bad and a drinks service. However, on the inbound BA had no white wine - apparently there is a problem with their suppliers. Did not pre-book seats due to the extortionate fees for pre booking. Just about any other airline will not charge for pre booking a seat if you are in premium classes. Back to the flights: both in a new, or nearly near A320, both very smooth with no timing issues at all so all good in that respect. Not a good check in experience at Tenerife South - just tacked onto the end of a large Tui check in queue. Also not a great lounge - the VIP lounge is merely adequate with OK seating for an hour or two. I would only just about recommend - there are still reservations about exactly what BA is trying to become.':\n",

Good job it was an overnighter so we managed to sleep a bit and not have to climb over our neighbours very often. The March film selection so not good. Not particularly friendly FA who insisted face masks must be worn even though BA's policy has changed regarding flying back to a non-mask wearing destination (ie. London). Sort it out BA. Took off 20 minutes late but big tailwind so more than made up the time on a relatively smooth flight. Dinner not to bad but breakfast - fairly dire. My wife's smoked salmon bagel was dreadful.

Played a game of find the chips/crisps - which were hidden on a table in a dark corner in one of the 3 areas. This is a crazy expensive route in Business Class and it feels like a rip off across all the airlines however the quality of BA's business class has much improved with the introduction of the suites. The privacy is a big improvement as too is the seat comfort and I managed a good 3hr sleep on the overnight red-eye flight. Food service was very efficient for those that wanted it and did the trick so late at night. Aside from getting a decent rest on the relatively short flight the other highlight was the flight attendant. Unfortunately, I didn't catch his name but he was superb, being responsive to the few requests I made and remembered my name throughout the flight.

Only a vegetarian dish or a chicken dish from the economy cabin. The airline must know that vegetarians will order a meal, so why include it as a choice. Also, to offer a roll of ham/cheese for breakfast after a 12 hour flight is cost saving. A hot breakfast should be offered.

The Tv screens are the size of a medium sized tablet and the controls are behind your head in a sitting position. There is no where to put anything except one small pull out draw at ground level that can not be reached when seated nor accessed when sleeping . The window seats and middle seats are accessed by having to jump over a passenger on an aisle seat and the seats are so low that they are hard for elderly to get out of.

I encountered odd problems with the meal as well - the lovely cabin crew member notified me that I had no other choice but to eat pasta for dinner because other choices had finished. You are better off in economy as you pay less and get the same service. Flight left on time and landed early. British Airways have in my opinion the  best inflight W-Fi service.

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  Grenada to Gatwick. Having flown with BA on this aircraft type prior to refurbishment, I was intrigued to experience the changes to the cabin. The cabin was much smarter - previous aircraft have looked very tired and the lighting was pleasant. The entertainment system was hugely improved, with a good selection of media on larger touch screen devices. I suppose the reason I appreciated this was because the old systems were so hopelessly outdated! But the family really found them entertaining. For me the real issue was the tight leg room - I am a slim 6ft 2'' and now the lack of seat width made it almost impossible to eat a meal! It was for me very tight. Previously the seat format was 3-3-3. It is now 3-4-3. We were sat in the 4 outbound although on return, we sat near the back of economy where the aircraft narrows and seats become 2-4-2. We sat in a 2, which was more bearable. I also found the seat really hard after a couple of hours although sitting on the supplied back rest cushion helped a bit! Despite best efforts to sleep, I failed..... I remember the old seats being more comfortable, especially for long haul. Service was professional and timely and food was similar to previous flights - edible. In summary, it seems a shame that BA have improved some aspects of the experience, but seat comfort has been sacrificed, which is a great pity.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to Copenhagen via London. The whole experience is a nightmare to me and my wife. My wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on 1st August because our two pieces of luggage were left in Heathrow Airport by BA staff when we took the transit flight from the UK to Copenhagen. We went to Menzies in CPH and they filed a repor. We stated in the missing report that if the luggage was found, they should be sent to our air b&b house in Marstal in CPH on or before 3rd August or deliver to the hotel we stayed in CPH if they were found on 4th August. On 2nd August, we found that the updated status of our missing luggage in the BA website showed that one of our luggage was found while another one had a possible match. Therefore, we kept phoning and emailing Menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so. And the website status showed that we chose to pick up the luggage in the airport, which was not our preference but we failed to change the preference on the website as it was preset. The system even changed the latest delivery date to 3th August 2020 instead of 2019 and we could not correct it by ourselves! On 3rd August, Menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport. Unfortunately, when we went to the CPH airport on the 4th August, they told us that they had already sent the 'found' luggage to the island in Marstal on 4th. Apparently they did not follow our instructions and sent it to the wrong place on the wrong date. They then asked us to find the other luggage that had been scanned with a possible match randomly in the trolleys outside their office. We did find the other one by ourselves in the airport, which they claimed had been sent to the island but they insisted that it was the possible match one! They were so incompetent and even asked us to complain to the BA to push them to find the baggage for us. We believe that the baggage was the one which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up. We were so confused which bag was really missing. We finally decided to ask them to deliver the luggage in Marstal to the airport and send it to the UK address which was our next destination. When we came back to the hotel in the evening on the 4th, we phoned Menzies again and found out that our luggage in Marstal had been sent back to the airport at 8 pm on the 4th. Hence, we decided to pick it up by ourselves on the 5th August before we flew to the UK. However, when we came to the airport again, we couldn't find our luggage and the staff didn't explain why and just told us to leave. If the luggage was sent it to the airport on the 4th, how come it would disappear on the 5th? The staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no one had time to look for the baggage for us. This service was totally unacceptable. We spnet hours parking at the airport and found that we got nothing! You can't imagine how furious and frustrated we were! We are literally sick of phoning Menzies staff every day and not getting anywhere. Now that Menzies staff asked us to pressure BA to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage. That's how ridiculous things have been for us. We are sure that you could do something about it. My wife has lost all her personal belongings since day 1 of our trip.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  I arrived at the airport about 2.5 hours before takeoff to have more than about time to get checked in, go through security, etc. All that went without any issues. Being that I was relatively early at the gate, I was one of the first passengers there. After some time boarding had opened. First the business class got called up, then families with children and disabled people. A couple minutes into the boarding they started to call up people, one by one, by name. Then there was an announcement: they won’t let anyone in anymore. Me and about fifty other people were still standing at the gate not being let in. The reason, they said, was that the plane was short staffed (Later I discovered, speaking to a manager, that not only the flight was short staffed but also it was overbooked). After the announcement people were getting angry because they wouldn’t be let in anymore. Nothing changed and everyone was sent away. I had a connecting flight later that day that I was going to miss because I was not let on the plane. First I tried to get my luggage back which I didn’t receive immediately but got a hold of later on thanks to the airport personnel. Then, just like everyone who was going to fly with the same plane, I wanted to talk to someone from British Airways. Since they don’t have a service center at Frankfurt Airport everyone went to the check-in counters where we received food vouchers but not a single person was either able to rebook my or anyone’s flight nor get anyone refunded. All the staff said was that we were going to receive an email in a couple hours with options to rebook the flight or get a refund. I waited four hours for the email at the airport that did not come until today. Trying to call the airline did not help either because they did not answer the phone or hung up in the middle of the conversation. After the four hours of waiting for the email me and some other people from the same flight went back to the check-in counter to get a confirmation from them that I will receive a refund. Being that there was a new shift the personell did not know what had happened. When they scanned my passport an looked at the flight they found out that the system was dying that it was my fault I could not attend the flight. It looked like I had missed it. For everyone standing there with me it was exactly the same. But the people at the counter said they could not do anything about it. Later on we were able to speak to the manager after many phone calls he said they were going to take care of it. We are supposed to get an email at some point in the future. I was not able to get a written confirmation that I will get refunded even after several times asking for it. I already flew a lot of times in my life but never ever has such a thing a happened to me. Not only that me and so many other people were not let into the plane but also the customer service being so horrible that they were not able to rebook or confirm a refund in any way. In the end the only option for me to get to my destination would have been to book a last minute flight for a lot of money which I would not know if I ever got it backed.':\n",

This wasn't the case. After waiting for several days I contacted them myself and instead of the 21.99 reimbursement that I can use towards a nice meal on holiday they've given me 5000 AVIOs. I never want to fly with them again so why give me service points when I was told by cabin crew I would be refunded - the only reason I even bought this WiFi pass as it's not even good enough to watch anything with because the connection quality is so poor.

I gave us over 3 hours for our connecting flight to and from home through Heathrow. Our flight left Seattle an hour late causing us to miss our connecting flight. We were rescheduled before we even landed. They booked us on a flight 7 hours later and offered no food tickets or any other type of reimbursement. Additionally we sat in their customer service line for an hour and a half to see if they could rebook us on an earlier flight, to watch them continually assist other customers that walked up outside of the queue (no earlier flights were available). When we arrived in Nice, France the airport was closed, including the rental car desk. We were not offered any assistance from the airline on a room or other accommodation for the night. We found a cab, which cost us 85 euros one one to get to our hotel. We thought there is no way something like this could happen on the way home….we were wrong. Our flight from Nice to Heathrow was 30 minutes late, with a 2.5 hour layover you would think we should still make our flight, unfortunately long security lines caused over 1.5 hr further delay. When arriving BA closed the doors and said they could not hold the plane any longer despite arriving 15mins before departure. After running through the Heathrow airport and going through security again. They sent us back to the customer service queue, where the first statement was we can’t get you out until tomorrow. After begging they found us a flight on another airline. At that time we were told our bags were transferred to our flight with Delta. We were given 8 pounds each for snacks at the airport for our now additional 5 hour delay. In total for our trip there and home we spent 13 hours at Heathrow airport which our original total layover of 6 hours, and we were offered 8 pound each. Unfortunately the drama continues. The two bags that they said made the Delta flight, shockingly did not. We were told that we had the file the claim with Delta, since the last part of our flight was with them. We have now been home for 5 days and each airline is pointing the finger at the other. As I said to both of them today. I don’t care who’ has my bags figure it out and send me my luggage I don't want your $500 reimbursement per bag, as that doesn’t come close to the memories and stuff that I have in there.

Sadly Mum passed away very early on the morning of 22 February. I contacted BA again the next day. They said because I had booked through Webjet, I needed to contact them. I phoned them, they said they would contact BA. No follow up from either. When I phoned Webjet again, they said still no word from BA. When I phoned BA again, they said they couldn't help. At this point I gave up and booked with Qantas, paying for another flight. BA's complete lack of compassion (apart from a couple of platitudes), and lack of interest in helping me in any way, astounded me. Needless to say, I will never use British Airways again.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  I flew on British Airways Cheapest Fare which was a Hand Baggage Only fare in Economy Class. Despite this being the cheapest fare you can actually carry two pieces of cabin luggage both weighing up to 23KG each. The value for money here is incredible. The ground staff at London Heathrow are very polite and helpful. The plane was clean and the cabin crew were very smiley and polite. This was a short haul flight but we were given a free packet of crisps and a bottle of water. There was Wifi onboard which we paid £11.99 for the full flight access package and it was great. It was fast enough to stream a movie on Netflix. If you are considering between a low cost carrier and a premium carrier like BA pay the extra and fly with the premium carrier. With the generous cabin luggage allowance and the free snacks on board it may end up being cheaper and nobody claps when the plane lands.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  I flew with BA recently from Sydney to London, deciding to return back home from travelling due to the coronavirus situation. The first ticket I booked with them was via Hong Kong. After booking, HK closed it's borders so I could no longer get this flight. I rang up BA who advised that the HK flight was not yet cancelled on the system so they couldn't yet book me onto a new flight yet. The customer service agent assured me he would ring me back at 11am the next day as it would be cancelled on the system by then and he would tell me what flight BA would be putting me on as a replacement. 11am came and went the next day and I had not received a phone call. I tried ringing to find out what was going on and was on hold for 5 hours and still no one answered! I decided to book myself onto another flight as there were hardly any left available and I didn't want to end up stuck in Australia. I had not received the promised phone call or even an email to tell me what my replacement flight would be so felt I had no other choice. When I got back home I raised this with BA. They told me that I was supposed to process an 'involuntary change' to get a replacement flight - that is not what the customer agent advised me! I'd never even heard that term before. He simply said BA would sort it out and put me on a replacement flight, he didn't say I had to do anything. So now because I was given the incorrect advice, I am out of pocket by a considerable amount. I raised it with the BA complaints team that I had been advised incorrectly and if I had been told I needed to do an involuntary change myself I would have done so. They were extremely unhelpful and just said that they don't know why I was advised incorrectly and there is nothing they can do about it. When I said that wasn't good enough they basically just fobbed me off and told me to go to a third party adjudicator if I wanted but they were not prepared to do anything.  I will never use this airline again.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  I had a future travel voucher for Singapore to London which I thought would be perfect for my flight to relocate home. I'd been under the impression that it was a simple process - just call up and book onto the same route that I'd previously paid for (and that had previously been cancelled by BA themselves) - but on a new date. How wrong I was. First, I had to pay to top up my flight - a significant amount, equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles. This was because of price increases and the fact that I was flying at peak times. The extra charge also meant that I overall paid more than face value (their online price at the time for the ticket) for the flight, as well as them still keeping the airlines I'd redeemed. They explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and that's just how the system works. However, if I had taken a refund I would have lost a lot of money to administration fees. They had me in a desperate situation where I was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what I did, so I cut my losses and booked the flight. Or at least I thought I did. The call centre agent - who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision (and no way to escalate issues) - took my card details (including full card number, dates, and CVC code) - and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra bag would follow. A week later, I still had no ticket, no details, no charge to my card, no booking reference - nothing. I called up to confirm. The call centre agent I reached apologised and advised he would escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details. Once again, I waited another week, and sign of being booked onto a flight. Thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to British Airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight, spanning over 6 weeks.  On the Friday before my Monday flight, I sat in tears to another BA call centre agent who promised to get me on my flight and book my extra bag. The next day - around 48 hours before I was due to fly, I finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra bag. Luckily, I noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a bag online. The whole experience was stressful, costly, and resulted in me spending hours and days on the phone listening to British Airways hold music. Furthermore, there has been a significant cutback to BAs inflight catering service due to COVID, resulting in smaller portions, leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight. Though I've flown BA repeatedly with few problems in the past, their service has gone significantly downhill.':\n",

The single concession they made was to allow me to board 1st, but did not offer a wheelchair, so I had to swing myself down the aisle to my seat using the arm rests of all 21 rows before my seat, as the aisles are not wide enough for crutches.

The on board service is different than before Corona times but it’s still very good. Tasty lunch box from DO&CO with fresh chicken sandwich, oriental vegetable salad and and amazing chocolate mousse. The choice of drinks was wide, including a very good quality Champagne from Nicolas Feuillatte. All in all a perfect flight experience with British Airways.

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  I think British Airways needs to be much clearer about what their Covid-19 \"travel flexibility\" really means, because it doesn't pass the common-sense test: I purchased a round-trip business class ticket from New York to-and-from Mykonos through London. I traveled there with no problem. The day before my return to New York, though, I took my Covid-19 test and learned that I tested positive. I tried to call the airline on the many usless numbers they provide on their website. The recorded message drones on and on about how they have no one to answer the phone because of Covid safety and simply says \"therefore we can't answer your call; try again.\" No ability to leave a call-back number or a voicemail, etc. For whatever reason the BA website thought that I had bought the ticket through a third-party agent (I did not - I bought it on BA.com) and so wouldnt let me cancel or reschedule the flight on the web site. I called and called over the coming days and could not get through to the London, Athens or New York lines. Two days later after having 2 negative PCR tests (the most accurate test), I learned I was not positive and so had to buy a new $5000 return flight to the U.S. I've now been calling the BA USA customer service line for nearly a month at least every other day, never to get through. Finally did and have been told that the fact that I couldnt get on the flight because of a COVID scare counts for nothing. The fact they dont have enough people answering the phone counts for nothing. Or that I was unable to change the flight to a few days later on the web site becuase the ticket was mis-booked.

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled London to Doha on July 16th, I had to physically check in at BA Business T5 because I had an ongoing connection in Doha and the flight was a code share with Qatar. I had paid for my flight through Qatar and paid for the seat online so I could sit where I like to sit and when I got to check in discovered I had been reseated elsewhere in the cabin and was told that was their policy and basically to shut up about it. I then discovered that BA do not recognise Qatar frequent flyer rules despite sharing Avios points. I'm a Gold card holder in Qatar which affords me extra kilos on the baggage but BA tried to tell me I had to pay. After some arguing eventually they accepted it! The Lounge was packed, staff less than helpful when I tried to get some answers on my seat reassignment, I was told I would get my money back - no chance of that so don't even try. The flight boarded by bus, the journey took 15 minutes to get from terminal to aircraft which I am guessing was at another terminal because it took so long to get there. Why not board us through that terminal rather than drag us all over the airport? Finally got onto the plane, BA staff are not friendly, it's no wonder they are ranked 13th, I now realise it's a privilege being allowed to step onto a BA flight and it departed 90+ minutes late. Myself and many other travellers had connections and this meant I was either going to miss the connection or I would manage to make the connection but my luggage wouldn't. Would BA flight crew help me on board to figure out the connection? they eventually came to tell me me in their haughty attitude, \"We are now landing 15 minutes earlier so that give you a full 50 minutes to make your connection\" Landing early does not mean getting to the gate earlier, it usually takes at least 10 minutes from landing to gate, then another 7 for the jetway to be attached and if you are lucky to be sitting near the door straight off, if not 20 minutes to disembark, if you want to be helpful don't say stupid things to people who are frequent travellers! As it turned out I was sitting near the door and had to run off the plane, Qatar were there to assist but I did have to run from the A gates all the way to C gates to make my connection, not a short distance for a 70+ year old and the luggage did not make it. Many others were not as fortunate and didn't make their connections. Why put a page in the flight entertainment for connections if you are not going to provide the information, it's public information you can look it up on line, so the aircraft has access to WiFi and satellite communication so I fail to understand why this information cannot be captured and displayed? I complained to BA got a wishy washy email with a number of excuses in it, no mention of the seat refund. I got a paltry voucher that I'm supposed to use on another BA flight - who are they kidding I am not sure I want to experience that again. However I have recently discovered that of my frequently travelled to destinations is really only serviced by BA if I want to fly at a reasonable hour of the day or go all over Europe just to avoid them which is too expensive. I consider them one of the worst airlines I have ever flown and getting worse by the minute. Fly them only if you absolutely have to and good luck.':\n",

A number of people wearing face masks incorrectly (over mouth or as a chinstrap) throughout the flight, and there was a fair amount of time when masks were off for the free snack (small bag of crisps and 250ml of water).  It seems crazy to allow a considerate amount of time with masks off or inappropriately worn in such a small space with no safe distance whatsoever. Also, only the absolute minimum of service which, given COVID, is understandable but makes the flight really boring - or not, since some excitement was provided by turbulence, with very little information from the flight deck. Disembarkation was chaotic to say the least but Terminal 5 was empty and vast enough to allow to finally distance. An upgrade for 89 Euros one was was available but it didn't seem to make sense.

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  I was supposed to fly with Aeroflot on the 23rd of December to Moscow. But because Russia has closed its borders, like the majority of other countries, the flight was canceled, and I couldn’t get home. I’ve also tried to fly through Antalya, but the same situation occurred. On my third try, I came to Heathrow and tried to fly away to Cairo. I was declined by another company. Then I went to British Airways. Starting from testing (because Egypt requires tests), as stressful as the whole situation was, the employees were outstanding! (I’m not sure is it connected to BA, but still, I want to mention this). The crew was very helpful and extremely understanding, very professional and urgent to help, they have been a great help and I am very gracious for this. I want to separately point out one employee - Shanell (if I am not mistaken, who works at Collision testing center in Heathrow Terminal 5). She is a savior and most importantly a human, which is very rare nowadays! Carrying on, I went to BA check-in, but unfortunately couldn’t do it, as my results didn’t go through yet. However, another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive. I’ve come to her 3 times with additional questions, and every time she was very patient, professional, and happy to help. After I got my results I came back to Heathrow on 24th, but unfortunately, there were no flights to Cairo, the situation became even more complicated (I will spare the details). However, here again, brilliant employees of BA offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me. The nicest lady I’ve ever met, unfortunately, I didn’t catch her name, but I am aware it was her first day at BA and that she is Egyptian, followed me throughout my struggles, offered me emotional and professional support. She tried to find any possible ways for me to get back home and actually did. She was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which I can’t thank her enough. She also asked her colleague to help me, which he kindly did.  Lastly, the nice lady (shame I don’t know her name) also shared my struggles with her colleague Mani who came to substitute her on the position. He was very friendly and attentive as well, talked me through the process, offered different ways I can stay at the airport, gave his phone to call, and offered to drop me off at the hotel, which he did not have to do whatsoever. To conclude, I merely want to thank all of these individuals one more time, as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects, I honestly do not know what would I do if I haven’t met them. I don’t know was I just lucky to meet these people or all BA employees are of the same morality, but I do want to thank BA for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines! For some people, the help that was provided to me might seem like a normal thing to do. However, for me, it was a pleasant and so much needed surprise. As no one in':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  It is first time we have flown BA business class in a 777 aircraft and hopefully it will be the last. Firstly, the check-in and crew were great - friendly and helpful. It was manual check-in, not a machine, which is always much nicer. No complaints at all in that department. Food on the journey was adequate but no choice of starter, or desert and 3 choices for main course, Business class seating is 2-4-2 with alternate seats facing backwards, as are both the centre seats. We were in those, so you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat, or you put the screen up  and you are in a claustrophobic bubble. You cannot see out. You cannot see other passengers. It was slightly better as it was my wife and myself, but it would be utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger.  Nowhere to put a glass, bottle of water, book, or glasses within easy reach, unless you keep the table down. In most business class seats you can tuck your bag under the seat in front for take off and landing, but there is nowhere to put a bag, so everything has to go in the overhead locker, and they are missing over the first 4 rows of centre seats, so not much storage space. We were in row 1 and to get out you have to climb over the legs and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row 2. Now if you are travelling solo in the centre seats that is always the case, but normally if, as a couple, you take aisle and centre at least you are climbing over your partner's legs, not some stranger. I am 5ft 10 and could just about manage. My wife at 5ft 4 could not get over without disturbing the passenger in the row behind. The reading light was hopeless and did not shine on your book and the light controlled from the handset did not work at all. This is utterly awful design and will certainly make us avoid BA in future, if at all possible.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  I’ve been flying with BA for years and never had any issues. I recently had to arrange to have surgery in Budapest and naturally wanted to fly BA. So I booked my flights from BHD to BUD via LHR online on their site. Once booked I informed the hospital and confirmed my appointment. The very next day I received an email from BA telling me they had cancelled my flight to BUD but not to worry as they had moved me to an earlier (a much earlier) flight the same day. Only problem was this earlier flight departed around two hours before my flight from BHD arrived. I would have thought that this would have flashed up on their system as being an issue, but seemingly not… *interlude* To get into Hungary during covid one needs a valid reason, with medical treatment being one. I had to fill in a very confusing form on the Hungarian police website that was a confusing mix of Hungarian and pidgin English. Anyway form filled in with flight numbers etc, emailed to the authorities there and exemption granted. So I took the earlier flight but this meant I had to fly into London the previous evening and stay overnight in a hotel. So operation booked, hotel booked, airport transfers booked immigration papers amended and re sent and admiration granted and flights re booked, what could go wrong? Around three weeks before I was due to travel, BA, rather unsportingly, decided to cancel my flight to BUD again. Needless to say I was furious. I complained to BA customer services and was given a stock excuse about covid disrupting air travel. Great excuse, only having looked at BUD arrivals info, Ryanair had been flying there once daily for at least the preceding several months. So BA’s covid excuse rang somewhat hollow. Epilogue: I got refunded most of my money from the flights I booked with BA, although they refused to refund my BHD - LHR flights because who knows? I also lost the money I had spent on a hotel and half of the money I had spent on booking airport transfers. Given the cavalier attitude BA seem to have to bookings and their indifference to ruining weeks of preparation on my part and the fact that I lost a not inconsiderable sum of money, I’ve decided to avoid BA from now on.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  Just a few years ago flying on BA was enjoyable, but times have changed. These days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at all. The Terminal 5 experience still feels classy, and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient. On board though, it’s just become an experience to be endured. BA’s mean decision to split seats into nicer for the first half of the plane, and nastier for the rest underlines this. There is no entertainment, no magazine. Refreshment purchases are brought to the seat after ordering from an app. There is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day, despite the competition being able to do this. Is it too much to ask for, when trapped on board for five hours? You get a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal bar. On the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing, but helpfully tied a bag around a toilet door down the back in case anyone wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves. Recline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezed. On the return flight, for one reason or another due to BA’s delays from the previous day, we were just under two hours late getting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldn’t travel at all because there were not enough crew. The cabin crew were nonetheless distinctly more professional on this flight. Altogether, I would say good things if there were any - but it’s hard to think of anything I could recommend BA for; and that is a pity, because it used to be a professional company to deal with and a pleasure worth looking forward to when making European journeys.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  LHR check in was quick at the First Wing and quickly through security. The First lounge was quiet for a change and a reasonably good breakfast buffet available. While BA have brought back their Highlife magazine in the lounge, it seems they used Covid to scrap all the other magazines they used to offer, as part of the endless BA cost cutting. The toilets in the lounge were as disgusting as ever, not cleaned frequently on this visit and they are about 20 years out of date (the public washrooms in T5 are better and cleaner). Boarding was the usual BA muddled mess, and two of the gate staff appeared to have no clue what they were doing. Endless announcements at the gate about being a full flight, requesting passengers to check in bags, only to get on a flight that was less than 40% full. Onboard a very good welcome from Captain and the flight left the gate only 5 mins late. Breakfast had 3 choices and was a fair standard. No hot towels or even packet towels offered in Club Europe any more, another part of the relentless BA cost cutting. I wouldn't mind but fares are proportionately a lot higher now than pre Covid. Cabin staff service was perfunctory at best, not a scrap of recognition for BA Gold or Oneworld Emerald members, clear proof that BA really don't care any more. Breakfast trays cleared 45 mins into the flight, and that was the sign for staff to stay in the front galley for the rest of the flight. Paid £4.99 for 1 hours wifi, and dropped connection for the next 40 mins. Sad to note that staff service on Ryanair is more pro active nowadays. Priority tagged suitcase came out nearly last at Malaga, this is standard for BA business class baggage handling. Do not waste your money on Club Europe, standards just keep dropping. ':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  Las Vegas to Gatwick. A very disappointing service for Club World, it felt like I was travelling in economy (with attitude). Especially considering the very high cost of the flight (I've paid half as much less for business class returns to Australia). We got off to a bad start when offered one third of a glass of champagne (about 2 cm in the bottom of the glass). My initial drink after take off was not what I ordered, when I queried it, I got a lecture on this was how it should be. No wine arrived with dinner, until I asked for it a second time (out of stock of the first choice), no second glass of wine offered. Yes, I could have used the call button, but 1/3 of a glass of champagne and one glass of wine being offered on a 10 hour business class flight? Other than the initial bottle of water, and a glass of water with dinner, no other water was offered until I got up and went to the galley to ask. The good news is the food was good and well presented. Although the promised (on the menu) selection of pastries with breakfast were not served (I later walked past the galley to see the crew eating them for their own breakfast). We had dutifully filled in the pre-order card for breakfast, only to find we were being asked again at breakfast. Sleeping was impossible due to the temperature being so high, I actually thought I had a fever (I was so drenched in sweat) until I spoke to a colleague who was the same. I'm used to flying ultra long haul with Middle Eastern airlines, so I'm used to hot cabins, but this was crazy. Only when the crew dropped the temperature a few hours before landing (presumably to wake us up), was it bearable enough to sleep. Combined with the a very dry cabin air, it was very unpleasant. No need to say anything much about the eight across seating as I know the seats are being upgraded over the next few years, other than they are very cramped if sitting next to a window. I do like the semi-reclined position for take off and landing though. I have fairly big shoulders and found the seat width very restrictive. There is nowhere to put your spectacles or bottles of water if lying down. Being on the second aisle, we had to join in with the economy passengers queuing to disembark, so it wasn't quick. At no point did any member of the cabin crew introduce themselves other than via a general PA announcement. The seats I can forgive as they are being addressed, but the service was budget airline level. Really BA, you need to do much, much better. The ground staff in Las Vegas were fast, friendly and efficient. The lounge was something from the dark ages, all 1970's wooden panels.':\n",

I used the BA website to reserve the seat and food the website to be easy to use and clear in every aspect. The flight was due to depart from terminal 3 but the passengers were bussed for a good 15 minutes to a different part of the airport where the aircraft was on a stand. When boarding the flight the cabin-crew kept a very low profile and this was maintained during the entire flight. The captain made 3 brief announcements during the flight. There was no in-flight entertainment. The seats were clean and comfortable enough for a short flight. The lack of catering was overt. Other than a tiny bottle of water and an inedible “breakfast bar” one had to use an online system to order even a drink and of course pay for it too. The passengers next to me could not use the online system as it doe not seem to work and the cabin refused to sell them a coffee because of this fault. Moreover, the USB charge points did not work either. Given the early hour of the flight it is a poor show that there are not even for sale items available from a trolley service. The system BA have in place is not good enough. The flight arrived on-time. The disembarkation was inefficient though and poorly managed and the crew were not to be seen. The crew were wearing the new BA uniform and it seems to reflect a downward trend of the airline. To be candid, there was any difference between this BA service and that of so-called “budget” rivals. On this route BA have a monopoly and so I did not have an option to use the services of a different company.':\n",

It was a rather clinical flight and exceptionally basic. I received a small bottle of water and two broken digestive biscuits. The wifi did not work and the ridiculous skyshop was not accessible either. I asked for a coffee and the cabin crew member kissed his teeth at me. Is this how low BA has fallen?

Firstly they cancelled our flight a few months before departure, meaning we had to go a day earlier and pay an extra night in a hotel. The plane was old and cramped, making it difficult to get up and walk around during the 14 hour flight. The entertainment system was pathetic. Not much film choice, a random selection of tv programmes, and no games. The drinks service was lacking, my food was awful and there were no snacks offered in between. On other long haul flights we have had comfort packs with toothbrush/toothpaste etc, no such offerings.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  London to Dublin. It was never my choice to fly with British Airways and I will never fly with them again. I was supposed to fly with American Airlines from the USA to Dublin, but I had a connecting flight from my origin city to Chicago. Unfortunately, my first flight was delayed due to weather, which caused me to miss the flight from Chicago to Dublin. I was put on a flight to London instead, which I had to run for when I finally made it to Chicago, and my bag did not make it on the flight. I then flew with British Airways from London to Dublin. I was told to file a lost baggage claim with BA, which I did. I was told that the bag would be transferred from American to BA when it arrived in Dublin. Using American’s baggage tracking system, I was able to confirm that the bag arrived the day after I did around noon on Saturday. I am writing this review on the following Sunday and the bag is still not in my possession. BA’s customer service is terrible. If someone there tells me one more time to just wait and be patient, I am going to lose it! My bag has been sitting at the airport in the same city I’m in for more than a day and I can’t get it. Talk about serious frustration. I don’t know which airline is at fault for the delay, but the difference is that when I called American, the rep did everything she could to find out the status of my bag. And even though their baggage claim desk was closed when I called, she still tried to call an internal number to see if anyone was still around. Unfortunately she couldn’t get hold of anyone, but she left them a message and told me exactly who I could call and when to call them the next morning. I did not receive that level of service from BA. I even asked if they could call the airport and was told, “we are not authorized to call airports.” Why in the world wouldn’t they be authorized to call their own baggage department? I am not thrilled with either airline, but at least American has made some attempt to help me. This has ruined the first three days of a trip that I planned for two years. If you do check a bag and it’s lost or delayed, don’t expect any help if you flew with BA. And here’s a tip: if you are dealing with a lost or delayed bag in a country you don’t live in, don’t call the generic customer service number on the website you would normally use. Dig around and see if you can find a number for the airport you flew into. You will get a lot more information and assistance that way. ':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  My family and I have flown mostly on British Airways for the last 30 years. I am a priority passenger and fly often enough to recognise cabin crew and know some by name. They used to be a really good airline to fly with. Things have really deteriorated with their face to face customer care since the pandemic. The aircraft look worn. For example, on my flight back my audiovisual equipment did not work and had to be reset twice, finally working in the last hour before we landed. The second time around, I think the reset was done for the whole aircraft. The touch screen function on my screen did not work. The USB charger ports on my seat did not work. The staff were pleasant enough, but their service oozed mediocrity.  There did not seem to be much pride in what they were doing. The food has been the worst part on our BA flights since the pandemic. They gave us a menu, asked what we’d like, did a check and then told us that it was not available as they had run out and would we like to choose something else. They then told us that we’d get first choice at the second service which they couldn’t deliver on. Finally after choosing and getting whatever it is that we did, the food was tasteless. We take part in post flight surveys regularly and have stated all of this, to no avail. As a family of 3, we fly British Airways medium to long haul regularly, possibly 4-6 times a year each. For us, the good things about flying BA are that we are priority customers, usually have a direct flight to our destinations and get good service on the ground, when checking in and in the lounges when we use them.':\n",

I applied for compensation lawfully due me through EC261 but their customer relations department refused by carelessly determining that my flight had arrived in London under the 3-hour delay window for compensation even though my final was clearly Paris and their CR agent acknowledged this. After I pointed out the error she ignored me so I filed a claim with the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution and BA sent them a defences. They claim I traveled on AF65 and arrived in London ahead of schedule. The truth is that BA at LAX rebooked and reticketed me on that flight however AF refused to accept me and my baggage unless I paid them a surcharge. So, BA then rebooked me on flights to have me arrive very late into Paris and misconnect and have to overnight there. I do not know which is more shocking that BA would lie to the authorities in order to support their indefensible position or that their agents do not know how to read a passenger name record's air history.':\n",

The call center suggested that we cancel the flight for a full refund, then claim compensation for the delay and difference in airfare cost and other non refundable bookings due to the delay and cancellation of our flight. British Airways responded to the claim after a month with no compensation at all, even though we paid additional $600 on new bookings and additional charges. The refund of the cancelled flight took more than a month with multiple calla to follow up almost every week. I was promised to get refund on the first call but later I found out it was not processed properly. Every-time I call the agent ask questions about why flight was canceled etc which is annoying when my understanding everything was under process for payment.

The nightmare continued when I landed in Malaga sans luggage, containing essentials for my son's wedding. Thirty agonizing hours later, the bags showed up—but my brand-new iPad and a special watch for my nephew were missing. The items weren't merely valuable; they had emotional significance, which made the loss even more gut-wrenching. You'd think a reputable airline would make amends for such  errors.  Despite the clear mishandling of my baggage by their team, they refused to offer any reimbursement or even a modest amount of airline credit. Their customer service was not only ineffective but also astonishingly callous. Their response was, in essence, \"It's your fault for trusting us with your belongings.\" This isn't just poor customer service; it's a complete disregard for basic human decency and responsibility. British Airways had numerous opportunities to right their wrongs and chose not to. If you have any respect for your time, belongings, and emotional well-being, avoid British Airways at all costs.

I was due to travel to Madrid with British Airways and before setting off I heard on the radio that there were flight delays. I looked at the Heathrow Airport website and saw that my flight had been cancelled. As a result of the information on the website, I called British Airways and have 26 minutes on hold I found myself speaking to somebody in a call centre in South Africa. The person was hard to understand due to a heavy accent and he was incompetent and insisted that the flight was not cancelled. I made my way to Heathrow and sure enough the flight was indeed cancelled. The woman in question had the audacity to declare that the flight was cancelled and that “there are no facilities here at the airport to rebook you”. She refused to let me and about 12 other people join the queue for the clearly marked assistance desk. The same woman and one of her colleagues gave out a card with a telephone number and told one rather elderly gentleman to “go online to rebook your seat”. I am visually impaired and found the attitude of the BA employee to be appalling. I called the number on the card the employee gave me and was again in a long queue to a call centre. The person who picked up the phone kept me waiting 22 minutes and declared that the flight was not cancelled and that the airport “must be wrong”. He then in a flippant tone said he was just informed that the flight was indeed cancelled and that I would have to go and speak to IBERIA customer services in Heathrow to rebook! I took the elderly gentleman with me to IBERIA where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with IBERIA. I returned to BA and this time I joined the check-in line and told a check-in agent what had happened. The man in question booked me onto the next available flight within a matter of a few minutes. He gave me a £30 voucher as a form of compensation but said he could not add my frequent flyer number with a partner airline. The voucher proved useless I am afraid as various shops in the predepature area refused to accept it and although I was told I could use it after clearing security none of the shops would accept it. Once aboard my new flight the service was minimal. Other than a tiny bottle of water and a packet of pretzels nothing else was available. This was a full flight as so many people had been transferred from the cancelled flight. BA Cabin crew announced that any additional items other than the small bottle of water and pretzels had to be ordered via their skyshop.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  My wife and I booked a flight in April 2022 that included a return trip from Edinburgh thru London to Washington. When we checked in at Edinburgh Airport 3 hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flight. We asked how this was possible and were simply told that others had checked in on-line (which we hadn’t done).  We were instructed to come back in 2 hrs and 15 mins, still with our luggage unchecked and not yet going thru security, to see if we could get on the flight via standby. We waited and then finally at 1:15 PM, 45 mins before our scheduled 2:00 PM flight, we were told we could be on the flight and were given boarding passes for the flight to London but no boarding passes for the connecting flight (1:55 mins after arrival time). Our luggage was not checked thru to Washington but only to London. We were told we’d get thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff would assist us. When we got to Security Check area the line was massively long. We questioned a BA staff member who said we had to get in line like the others. We decided to pay (12 pounds) to go through “Fast Track” Security to make our Flight. We got to the gate in time. Yet, due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggage-space issues on the plane, our flight arrived in London 45 mns late, and after going to the “flight connections” we were told 25 mins before the scheduled departure, with a vague explanation of “there isn’t enough time,” that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight. We were then directed to baggage claim to retrieve our luggage and then proceed to the check-in area to be rebooked for a later flight. When we got to the check-in counter area a BA staff person, standing at entrance to the check-in line, advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in 3 hrs. When we finally got thru on the phone, we were informed that the best BA could do for us was to get us on a flight 5 days later, and then not to our original destination (IAD), but to Baltimore. I was not told or assured I’d be compensated for this extreme expense of staying 5 more days in a hotel - just that I could go to the BA website and make a claim on-line.

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  Outward journey BA245 London to Buenos Aires Club World 10 January 2023. Our experience was poor from beginning to end. Although we had reserved seats 11F and 12J, another passenger was occupying 11F and crew made no attempt to address the problem. Eventually, I persuaded the passenger to move and occupy her designated seat 11D. We boarded punctually but were not offered drinks. When I asked for a drink, the crew member said it was too late and blamed the seating problem. The same crew member then began taking orders for dinner but did not write them all down and gave up after a few minutes for the safety briefing. She asked us to repeat our orders later. The hot flannels smelled musty and felt old and ragged.  One of the crew wondered aloud whether my companion and I were related.  My soup was cold, I was told it was served from flasks. Was that an explanation or an excuse? My coffee was weak and tasted like instant granules. My companion was initially served no bread roll with dinner. The breakfast menu stated a 'selection of rolls/pastries' but there was no choice and my companion was given a dried fruit pastry, where he would have chosen a bread roll.  Although we had not previously asked for or been offered any other than those supplied at the seat, small bottles of water ran out. Return journey BA244 Buenos Aires to London Heathrow World Traveller Plus 26 January 2023 was a huge contrast, from the warm welcome on boarding to crew’s professionalism throughout. It’s a poor reflection on Club World service that our experience in World Traveller Plus was so much better and kinder.

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  Overall, a very lovely flight with BA to Edinburgh during Christmas holidays. Lounge was ok, quite worn out, although staff and food were nice (much better than when I travelled last time). Although the plane seemed old, the cabin felt very fresh, clean, temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking (around 22-23C) and Had a funky lighting. Although seats are the same as those in Economy, they are pretty comfortable for a 1-hour hop (much better than those at Air France) and together with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful (for Gold card passengers, BA automatically reserves row 1 in Club Europe with enhanced legroom which I think is a great touch). The crew (especially the purser) were phenomenal: extremely friendly, adaptive to your needs and professional, leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste. Afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scones were tasty. I am actually a fan of well-presented, however simpler meals on board; to my opinion, they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust. For a quick hop, BA ticked all the marks here (in comparison, on a CDG-LHR leg Air France presented a ‘chic’ cold starter, however, to me, it looked a bit too complicated and, except from the duck terrine, rather unappetising / KLM served a super nice and simple Chicken Caesar but it was in a paper box). One big drawback was the First wing experience at T5: the queue there was so long that I decided to go through the regular lines instead. It’s quite disappointing given how much money regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a Gold status. Nevertheless, the flight and, most importantly, the crew completely negated that drawback. The flight was £200 one way (£600 return incl. transfer to Kirkwall) which was pretty expensive, however, the service seemed like it was worth the money.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  Paid for a 14 hour long flight ticket which includes use of the in-flight entertainment system. Ended up in a seat where the in-flight entertainment system was malfunctioning and could not be used at all. Flight attendants sought to perform a \"service recovery\" through their customer relations team. Contacted by the said team slightly more than a week later with an offer of an eVoucher that can only be used in purchasing additional flight tickets with BA. Explained to them that I had no intentions of travelling again within the next two years so I had no use of an eVoucher and sought for an alternative form of compensation instead, something that could really be useful instead. Customer Relations simply brushed my request off as them unable to offer any alternate \"gesture of goodwill\".  Compensation in British Airways is a matter of \"goodwill\". Pay for a ticket but don't get what you paid for in full. Compensation is one that requires you to spend even more money on the airline (so that they can disappoint you further). An ultimately self-serving, inconsiderate, undiscerning and insincere compensation. Which in itself isn't even anything they feel guilty or remorseful about, because any compensation is a \"gesture of goodwill\", something you don't deserve in their view. ':\n",

At checkin they could not find my booking so a little wait while they rang someone who explains on the upgrade you get deleted from the system the checkin agent sees? Took about 5 minutes to resolve. Seat was nice enough. Stowage pocket in front a bit small. Food was reasonably nice. Shame that the bathroom is all the way back through economy and there is a bit of a queue. IFE system is good but selection mediocre. Worst part of the flight is that at CPT so we were on a remote stand and bussed in. Through passport control quickly but then it took an absolute age to get our luggage which ruined what would otherwise have been a reasonable flight. Upgrade was worth it at £200 maybe £300 (its a long flight) but their offers of £2000 or whatever for premium economy is comedy pricing. Score before the luggage fiasco would have been 7 or 8 / 10.

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  Recent trip to Boston, departing LHR T5. Ground staff were absolutely fantastic and made an extra effort to make sure we were prepared for all the COVID entry requirements in the US, they were really friendly and personable. Very short queues for bag drop and security, I would say it took us 20 minutes from kerbside to lounge which is fantastic considering what is going on in the UK at the moment. Boarding was very quick and efficient and was completed within 30 minutes. Seated on the last row of economy I really appreciated the low density 3-3-3 layout in economy compared to the 10 abreast seating. Myself and my colleague strategically booked the aisle seat either side of the centre and were lucky enough to have no one sat between us which really helped. Considering most of the foot space in these older seats is taken up by the IFE box it really helped and would have been significantly less comfortable had we been sat next to each other. The cabin crew were excellent, well trained and personable they were very visible throughout the flight and pro-actively offered drinks outside of meal service. Meal service was very efficient with cabin crew pro-actively removing trays from people who had finished early, something that you very rarely see in economy. The food by DO&CO was exceptional, I don't think i've eaten so much on a trans-Atlantic flight in economy. It will be interesting to compare it on the return flight when its catered by an out-station. Overall it was a great flight, helped by the additional space we had but nonetheless a good performance by BA which totally exceeded my expectations based on the reviews here and elsewhere.

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  Return trip Cape Town to Durban in Club Class highlighted the inconsistency. Our outbound trip in December was good in all respects, whereas the return trip was disappointing. Check in was fine, apart from the agent failing to label one of bags priority, resulting in a long wait for our third bag. The lounge was busy, but no complaints. We went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen, where there was no sign of activity, although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time. Shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from 1330 to 1410 and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates. The informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate. I checked on the flight radar app, which showed that our aircraft had started in Durban, and flown to Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, back to Cape Town, and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight. In fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late. Boarding eventually started at 1400 with departure at 1430, 60 minutes late. Drinks service only started 30 minutes later, followed by lunch. The food was good but the wine offering very mediocre, and not up to club standards. With the price of good wines in South Africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine. Lunch service was quick, but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested.

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  San Diego to Stockholm via London. Had I written this review immediately on landing it would have been zero out of ten. But I realise this would be unfair- BA is a game of two halves. The inflight experience is immeasurably improved from a few years ago. The food in Club is excellent, the cabin crew attentive and professional, the pilots are the best in the industry and IFE absolutely fine. The Club World product is competitive with the better European airlines such as Lufthansa and streets ahead of most US carriers. The problems start when anything goes wrong - which it frequently does given the mostly old fleet especially on non-core routes. In my case, the flight was cancelled due to the inbound aircraft (an ancient 747) going technical. Then a comedy of errors. First the hotel vouchers just said ‘Holiday Inn’. There are about 15 in San Diego- cue hordes of passengers looking for shuttle buses in the wrong place, arriving at hotels with no booking etc etc. Next, the replacement flights. The clunky app kept just saying error for some reason. Eventually the full website on a PC showed my replacement flights. But no booking refs or any statement if these were being offered to me, were confirmed or whatever. On calling BA they wouldn’t talk to me because I ‘failed’ security- I didn’t know the billing address of the specific booking which was done by my company’s travel department despite having a full executive club account that was associated with the booking and which they could have used. The next day I went to take the replacement flights- Alaska Airlines to Newark then SAS to Stockholm. Despite getting a boarding card and making it to my seat on the plane, I was pulled off minutes before takeoff. BA had not paid for the flight! A reservation had been created but no ticket issued. BA then booked me on a roundabout route back via Chicago plus a 12 hour layover from 4am to 4pm, getting me home over 36 hours after my original reservation. Later I spotted that the next BA flight which would get me home much sooner now had tickets available online, why was I not on this? When I called they had no explanation and only agreed to ‘exceptionally’ change my flight again after I complained about all of the above. Finally, I arrived home after a 24 hour delay and a roller coaster of incompetence. In summary, when all goes well, BA is better than it was and staff are doing a heroic inflight job. But old planes, rubbish back office IT infrastructure and plain incompetence mean this airline can be hell if anything goes wrong. And bear in mind I was travelling in business class- who knows how they treat economy passengers.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  Starting off at Heathrow Terminal 3. Check in was fairly easy, but fast track security was terrible. The area is currently under refurbishment but there are only two scanning machines in the fast track area and at this time only one was in use so the queue was long and very slow moving. I’ve heard mixed things about the BA club lounge, but I was fairly impressed. Food options were fairly varied and tasted really nice. Nice salads as well as pie and veg. Drinks as always in BA lounges are very easy to lay your hands on and cater for most wants. Lounge was a decent size with various seating options and wasn’t very busy at the time I went (Sunday evening). Boarding was well organised and club passengers / higher tiers was boarded quickly and easily. Amenity kit, bottle of water and bedding were waiting at the seat. Welcome drinks were provided fairly quickly after sitting down. Hot towel provided after take off, shortly followed by drink and nuts. As has been regularly said these nuts would be infinitely better if served properly not in a very small packet. Food service on board consisted of a main dinner service which was served 1-2 hrs after take off, then a breakfast meal before landing. Both meals were genuinely delicious. All meats were tender and juicy and very was perfectly cooked. Drinks were provided whenever asked, although crew were too busy serving all passengers to proactively offer top ups. Breakfast was offered to passengers as they woke up, which meant that people ate when they wanted rather than just in order.. almost but not quite like a la carte dining. Crew were friendly and efficient, with some nice personality coming through. This is fairly standard of my experience with BA. In flight entertainment was excellent. Good screen quality. Responsive touch screen. Excellent selection. I did not use the WiFi however it was available on this aircraft and prices are reasonable I think. The seat is generally very comfortable and the storage compartments are convenient and spacious enough. The crew on my aisle side of the plane forgot to unlock all the doors so people had to work out how to do it themselves or periodically request the crew to do it for them. Whilst you can never complain about a fully flat bed, the reverse herringbone layout does make the footwell a bit cramped and also means it’s a lot more comfortable to lie on one side rather than the other (facing away from the door). I did manage a few hours of sleep though so not too bad. Overall a really lovely flight and absolutely holding its own as a decent business class product/service.':\n",

Arrived and everything was actually right in front of us and actually found somewhere to sit after 5 minutes of looking around. Menu was basic with no eggs, hash browns or any breakfast cakes or muffins. Ordered a frittata as was so hungry. Made my way to the self-serve coffee counter which had basic coffee and was straight away put off by flies hovering over the croissants and fruit. Flight was departing from a gate where you had to take a train to and as if to rub salt in the wound were then told that DXB flight usually leaves from there and should’ve gone to the lounge near there. Looking at the individual cubicles which was to be honest our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart. However, the doors cannot close till take off. I asked for the artisan crisps or biscuits on the Menu and it took them over an hour. Lunch came in another almost hour. Asked if could swap puddings as am not a crumble person, said will surely try but clearly didn’t, with no apologies or even trying. Portions were small, plus saw quite a few fellow passengers sleeping through lunch so asked if could have more but all was finished. Chocolates are Lindor. Nothing special about the other amenities, toilets were no different to what you’d expect, amenity kit was basic, duvet seemed well used.

We chose out flights very carefully so that we were booked on flights with the Club World Suits not the Ying Yang arrangement that they still offer.

Most business class offer 4 across but this layout still squeezes in 8 across. As we only take one long haul leisure trip a year in Business Class we always lose out on the \"Points game\" but I take exception to having paid in full on a non refundable basis not to be allowed to reserve my seats. The points gained from this trip alone would have allowed us Bronze status but we were not given this status until after the trip when it is useless to us. This status would have allowed us to book the seats 7 days prior to departure, when they were still available, rather than the 24 hours when they were not available. On the long haul return flight I was unable to book a window seat but on boarding after the doors had closed there was a window seat still vacant. I asked if I could move and was told by the FA she would check. Nothing happened but after take-off a passenger was moved from economy to that seat. Judging by the interaction between them I would bet it was someone on Staff Travel. I think it disgraceful that a full fare paying passenger should be treated like this. Take-off was just after 1930 hrs but we were not offered a drinks service before supper but were told we could order a drink that would be delivered on out tray with the meal.

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  The usual shambolic unfolding that BA has now unfortunately been come to known for. We had a long weekend flight booked to Munich that was supposed to be departing on 9th February at 19:55. This happened to be our first flight with our newborn (3 month old) daughter. It turned out to be a horror show of incompetence. Just under 3hrs before scheduled departure, the original 9th February flight was cancelled. We received an email as we were boarding the Heathrow express. I’d booked a day of holiday off work for this trip. We ended up getting doing a round trip to Paddington instead. On the way back from the cancelled flight, both me and my wife tried calling BA. Despite one of us having silver membership (possibly the largest joke of a membership currently out there), I took us nearly 45 minutes to speak to someone who could help. I believe BA outsource their call centres and so you end up talking to people who are following a script. The result is that you might as well be speaking to an AI rather than a human. We often received the response similar to ‘computer says no’. If this is the service level for silver members I can’t imagine what a regular punter has to put up with. When the phone originally connected to a person, I had to wait 5 minutes as his computer booted up. - BA then proceeded to auto-book us onto a new flight for the next day but going to a different destination. Our original flight was to Munich and the auto-booked replacement flight was to Salzburg. When asking the robot at the BA call centre why they booked us on a replacement flight to a location 135km apart, they couldn’t understand my frustration.  Eventually, someone was able to book us onto a flight the following day at 17:00. Not ideal as I’d wasted a valuable day off work and the hotel wouldn’t refund us or move our booking, but at least we were going to Munich and not Salzburg. - The day of the new flight came round and, this time, we managed to get all the way to the check in desk. Upon arriving at the check in desk, we were told that our rebooked flight had just been cancelled 4 minutes earlier. No email. No text. No notification ever arrived from BA to tell us that the flight had been cancelled. Incomprehensible as to how this could have possibly happened. The check in person said I should get on the app to rebook. At this point, I didn’t know whether to explode with anger or cry. Luckily, another check in person had an ounce of sympathy and explained to the useless check in person that he could actually rebook us. We were booked onto another flight later that evening (19:55 - BA0958). Unfortunately, that meant 5hrs in the grotty lounge with a 3 month old baby. It appears that everyone now has access to a lounge and so there’s really no difference between the lounge and a hostel, other than you get free stuff in the former. This was not a pleasant experience. We did eventually arrive in Munich and, despite asking, didn’t get our push chair/stroller delivered to the front of the plane. The plane was a characteristically BA dumping ground - they used to give you sanitising wipes so you could clean your seat and tray table down but they seemed to have cut back on this service too. All in all, another shocking BA service. A lost day of holiday and not an an ounce of empathy/sympathy/understanding at all from any of the employees I interacted with.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  The worst journey in my life. The connection time at LHR was only 1 hour, but the flight from MXP was on delay. I had to rush to change terminal by train and arrived risking a heart attack. After that the plane just stayed there for another 40 minutes. Despite that, upon arrival at SJC my baggage was lost. I filled the form and gave to the employee. I was not given any receipt, so I did not have any reference number. BA phone number at SJC simply never answer. I called twice the toll free number and realized they did not record the delivery address. I had to enter myself online, dealing with a shitty website. They delivered the baggage three days later. I claimed for compensation online, as I had to buy clothes and other stuff and I did never get a receipt. I was expecting an upgrade for the flight back to MXP, but nothing happened, neither they allowed me to enter BA lounge at SJC. Bad customer service. The only positive side was price, but obviously this cannot justify this treatment and if I knew , I would never flown by BA. Never again!':\n",

I was looking forward to my new experience. I will not mention the chaos of changing gates several times, as these things may happen. What surprised me was the lack of attention to passengers. The flight was delayed by almost 3 hours. Even though staff offered vouchers, we had no idea where to get them, and we were told that we only had about 10 minutes to use them because boarding had already begun. Firstly, I did not see anyone with the voucher, and secondly, even if we got it, we were not able to use it. When I finally got to the airport, there was another waiting for about 30 minutes after cross check. Meantime, we were told that due to problems, they did not load any food, so the flight will be without any food on board. The only food offered and given to everyone on the plane was a small bag of nuts. As a business class passenger, I was offered drinks only. All in all, my business class contained 3 small glasses of juice.   I received no apology or compensation from the company at all. It was a disgraceful and cheap service for a very expensive price.

It's very obvious that if you are flying economy and not a frequent traveler of British Airways, they care very little about you. We had to wait an hour for them to even open the check-in. Once they did, they had 5 lines and only one that serviced economy. Even though the line for economy was three times the length of the premium classes. Then they told economy passengers that all bags had to be check and no carryon due to a full flight and no room in the overhead compartments.

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  Three flights, London to Reykjavik return and Frankfurt to London. Generally the flights were of an acceptable standard, though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a three-hour flight. The cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly. A big plus for BA was informative announcements from the cockpit, often missing on other airlines. Flights operated generally close to the advertised times. But BA was let down by chaotic check-in and boarding procedures. In preparation for each flight the number of check-in staff was one or at most two (in Frankfurt the lone check-in agent was also checking in Business Class passengers). Why are Economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the back? This was standard across the three flights, but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further back tried to get past forward seated passengers stowing their (enormous) cabin baggage. It would make much more sense to board people at the back first. And to enforce baggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last. The small bottle of water and a half-full bag of crisps offered as a snack on a three-hour flight to Iceland was just tokenism and compared badly with what Air France offered on a subsequent short flight to Paris. At Reykjavik there was no departure lounge next to the gate -- passengers had to queue wherever they could in the corridor.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  Toronto to Geneva via London. I stopped flying BA about three years ago after they dramatically downgraded their service. Apparently things have improved somewhat since, so I decided to give them another try. Overall, I was happy with my experience, save for two major gripes. On the plus side: I flew on new aircraft, which were comfortable, albeit with the usual narrow seats for modern aircraft (same with all airlines). Legroom on the 787-9 was generous and seemed to be more than the official 31\". Pilots were very good and informative, as always with BA. Quality of food on long-haul has definitely improved since the bad old days of soggy pasta and droopy sandwiches; I rather enjoyed the meals served, which were on nice large trays. The IFE was just about adequate, though surprisingly dated for such new aircraft. Cathay Pacific's is far superior. The two major downsides: 1. The new Basic Economy fare. It is really pesky and serves only to disgruntle passengers. BA really need to get rid of it. Virtually everyone on long-haul has to check in a bag, so please just include it in all airfare types. If I wanted to be nickle-and-dimed, I'd fly to Gatwick on a charter airline. Also, not being able to choose a seat even at the time of check-in is infuriating. I was automatically allocated a middle seat even though the entire rear half of the plane was empty! This just goes to show that you will get a middle seat unless you pay. Thankfully, the lady at check-in changed it to a window seat free of charge after I asked nicely. 2. No complimentary catering on short-haul. Seeing as virtually all passengers flying to/from Heathrow are connecting to/from long-haul flights with BA and have spent at least $1,000 on their airfare, I resented a drink and snack not being included on the short-haul segment of my trip. BA should not be treating connecting passengers the same as those on low-cost airlines who only paid a few dollars for a short trip. If BA would get rid of these two new features, I would not hesitate to fly with them again, as everything else about my trip was pleasant. As it is, I would still consider other airlines.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  Vancouver to Delhi via London. We were booked to fly from Vancouver to New Delhi via London Heathrow on Dec 22nd. We received an email on Dec 20th informing us about the industrial action in the UK. I called to find out how it may impact our travel. The representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refund. We called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions. We asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee. We booked new tickets with another airline with double the cost as our trip was urgent (simultaneously). He told us he no longer can cancel our tickets on the system but promised us he will make it happen because he told us we would get a full refund. He processed the cancellation. 5 hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldn’t be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline (we lost $1000 from cancelling the new tickets). Now, the representative claimed that he never said there won’t be any services available and asked us why we were worrying about the industrial action, and that other “arrangements” will be made if there were any issues (this was new information never given to us before). We kept our British Airway tickets. The next day, we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situation. We never heard back from the manager. As we logged in to check-in 15 hours before take off, we found that our VAN — LHR flight was cancelled (due to the bad weather in Vancouver). We did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this change. We called BA again and asked about rearrangements for our flight, to which they offered rebooking with an additional $700-1000 per person price difference and the dates offered were about 7 days after our original flight was supposed to leave. Additionally, to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled, we had to pay about $1000 cancellation fee to get a refund. We were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possible. We were on the phone for 1.5 hours while other flights that we could have booked were getting sold out - the customer service person would take 15-20 minutes (for real) to search up each question or option we asked about. It has been a frustrating experience - we lost time and money and it ruined our holidays completely. We then demanded to speak to the manager, who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation fee. In total, we were on the phone with them for 2 days back and forth, without any resolutions. We felt misguided and misinformed with their unfair policies towards their customers. We did not feel taken care of at all. We had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves. After all this trouble, we spent Christmas without our family and the missed the urgent reasons we were travelling for. ':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  Very inconsiderate PA announcements were made by a purser who appearingly decided to exchange his career at BA for comedy club acting, although not at the right setting. First pre-landing PA: “My colleague and I had a very long week with British Airways, so we are dimming the lights as we don’t want you to see our faces. If you are afraid of the dark - just look at the passenger next to you”. Although clearly not the purser’s intent, it sounded like a mocking and very careless of people with aero / darkness phobias who may have a panic attack after such a joke. Very inconsiderate and damages BA’s brand as a safe, accessible and a trusted airline. Second PA after landing was: “if you’d like to make a complaint, go call EasyJet”. I felt genuinely insulted by this “joke”. BA charged an abusive fee. In the end, I literally had to beg the rude and dismissive ground staff in Madrid not to check my roller bag at gate because I recently had surgery and needed to hold onto it to walk. Instant noodles which I purchased onboard were barely edible. All cabin crew except from one disappeared at the galley where they were loudly chatting and laughing and looked at me as a nuisance even when I just wanted to pass through them to visit the lavatory. And then the chief purser effectively announces that if anyone is unhappy they can go fly someone else. Wake up, BA! You are already worse than EasyJet and Ryanair in terms of value for money!! I note that only ones who found the purser’s jokes funny were the other cabin crew who made a few vulgar laughs, while passengers remained dead silent. I can understand airlines scaling back services to cut costs. I will never understand how you can allow your staff to openly mock and insult your passengers.

The woman at the counter was rude, I was actually embarrassed to be British at the time. Shouting, snapping at people and just had a real horrible way about her. On the flight from London to San Francisco, prior to the 24 hour check in, I spent £150+ to reserve two seats for our once in a life time holiday to America. Once we boarded, it was evident that the seat I was sitting in was broken. The recliner button was not working and had been pushed into the frame of the arm rest. I asked the flight attendant at the time of there was anything that could be done, but not only was she also rude, but seemed uninterested in that fact that I was going to have to sit for 11 hours on a flight with a seat that wouldn't recline. I eventually got the flight to state that she would report the fault, only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken. Attitude with British Airways staff has been absolutely horrendous. So, after getting off the flight, I decided to make a complaint to British Airways. Bearing in mind that I had paid £150+ for the privilege of picking a seat. I asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the 24 hour check in, only to be told no, they don't do refunds. I paid for a product that was broken, met with nothing but rude staff, and they are telling me they can't refund the cost of booking the seat? 4 emails to the customer team and they are still refusing, they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat. All they have now offered me is a £50 BA voucher, which I declined on the basis that if they picked my seats (for example I hadn't payed for the seats prior to the 24 hour check in) then a £50 voucher would be ok, but not when I have spent my own money to select a seat that was broken. After all my experiences with BA, I will not be using them again.

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  We booked on the BA website, round trip flights from Seattle to Amman with a stop in London, in Business Class. Our first flight was delayed and then diverted to NYC, and enroute my husband experienced a medical emergency. When we landed in NYC we were taken to a hospital and I stayed in constant contact with the airline agent who had arranged for the ambulance transfer. The same evening we flew back home, confirming cancellation of all remaining flights with the agent at the airport. For the next several weeks, we spoke many times with BA Customer Service, trying to obtain some kind of refund — we were met with contradictory explanations, excuses and an absence of meaningful customer service. We discovered we had been marked as “no-shows” for our flight to Amman and that our return flight was still active. We were unable to cancel the return on the website, despite booking on the website. Our phone calls were never returned, we spent a minimum of 40-60 minutes on hold for every phone call we made, our emails received only canned replies without answers or explanations, we were told it was “not possible” to receive a copy of the ticketing rules and regulations nor to speak with a supervisor, and after several weeks of this abysmal customer service I filed a complaint with the FAA. In response to my complaint I received an email from BA Customer Service explaining that they had reviewed my many requests for a “full refund” but that could not be accommodated due to the ticketing rules. They would issue flight credits - except for the portion for which we no-showed. They did not state how many credits.

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  We flew to Funchal, Madeira yesterday. Madeira has no COVID restrictions for entry, yet BA asked us to upload our NHS vaccination passes, before we could check in online. I received an OK about an hour later, but my husband did not, so I couldn’t check in online. We arrive at Heathrow 2 hours before departure and stood in a long queue for check in. There were just 3 desks open for a queue of approx 100 travellers. Then several people went on breaks or disappeared so we were down to one desk open, with the queue barely moving. I went to complain to various BA staff, who said the manager had been told and more people were coming. One blonde lady walked around for ages, shepherding travellers into the queue, before sitting down at a desk. Another man later did likewise, making us wonder why they hadn’t simply worked at the desks from the beginning. All in all we stood in that queue for a good hour, before almost running to the security queue, which thankfully moved quickly. Then we hurriedly bought a sandwich, walked to our departure gate and stood on the bus to the plane. The whole experience was extremely stressful; and took the best part of 2 hours. We did not have time to sit down until we did so on the plane. And completely unnecessary! If we had been able to check in online, this would not have happened. My husband’s vaccination pass is fine, but not required for Madeira. I think it is a systems failure as he received an email yesterday morning saying his pass was not in order, as did I, even though I’d previously been told, I could check in online. Also unnecessary as if BA had staffed the desks properly the queue would have moved. A staff member told us BA had laid off lots of staff during lock down and was now begging them to return, but having been treated badly, they didn’t want to. The flight itself was fine, on time. We were given a bag of crisps and a bottle of water, again fine, nothing praise worthy.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified |  When dropping off my luggage at the luggage drop off at Toulouse airport, I had my travel pram confiscated from me and I was forced to take my sleeping 2 year old in my arms while traveling alone with him at 5.30am. I was told by the staff outsourced by British Airways to check in passengers that only yoyo prams were accepted on board. I corrected her that it was \"yoyo type\" prams but she contested and told me that only yoyo prams would be allowed and if I insisted to keep my sleeping 2-year-old in his pram I would not be permitted to board the flight to London. This happened to 2 other families and we were forced to go to the oversized baggage area of the airport. To clarify my pram is the Silver Cross Jet stroller pushchair which I specifically purchased as it is conform to the British Airways specifications. I was then required to carry my toddler for 30 mins through security, and then again for another 40 mins while waiting to board the plane (I was \"allowed\" early boarding only to be moved from my seat to stand on the other side of the staff with no more options to sit down). At Heathrow, I was then required to carry my toddler again for approx. 40 mins to go through passport check and luggage claim (as mentioned previously, I was traveling alone with my child with no other support). All this, despite purchasing a very expensive pram to fit to your requirements and coming to the airport prepared with this pram. I'm sure you agree this is unacceptable and it is illegal to force passengers to purchase a specific brand of products in order to be able to keep their child in their travel pram.  In addition to this, once on the plane, I installed my Kids Fly Safe Cares Child Airplane Safety Harness for my son. The cabin crew then proceeded to tell me this was not allowed. I had to go on the website to show them that this was incorrect and I was in fact within my rights. Then, for landing, the crew had the gall to tell me to put the harness on my son and that it was mandatory to which I asked, if it was mandatory why did I bring the harness myself. British Airways is the most discriminatory airline for parents traveling with children and this needs to change. My advice; don't treat a mom traveling alone at 5am with a sleeping toddler like rubbish, and don't confiscate her travel pram that is within regulation forcing her to have the worst travel experience possible.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified | A last minute business trip to HND, a route I regularly fly. Overall a good experience. In the new club world offering which personally I like and find to have plenty of room although some say it is a little tight. I arrived LHR in plenty of time and used the first class wing as I am eligible due to exec club status. Great to see the security lane reopen and efficient due to the new \"no need to empty your bag\" scanners. Additionally the first class lounge was not as busy as usual so a nice experience. Boarding was from gate A10 by bus, probably the least enjoyable part of the journey. It's not uncommon for this flight to use A10 which baffles me as such a large number of passengers need to take the not so scenic journey past all the A gates, B gates and finally C gates before arriving at the aircraft. Even passing a few empty airbridge gates on route. Boarding was not well organised with no real announcements. They started checking in peoples bags and pre-boarding with no announcement which then confused people who thought it was general boarding and started moving forward. Group 1 was then opened before I got to the front on the queue Group 2 & 3 began boarding from a separate line and there were too many people waiting to board the buss so not enough room. Once onboard the aircraft was clean and I like the IFE offering in the new club world. Unfortunately I didn't find the crew particularly welcoming or engaging. I know its a lot of passengers and a long flight but there was not much smiling or customer service. At one point I had to walk through the galley to the toilet, on return 3 crew members were talking, one in particular was blocking my way and after looking at me proceeded to continue and didn't offer to et me past, eventually the inflight manager moved him to one side so I can pass. On another occasion I went to request a drink and was effectively scowled at in a look that felt like \"what do you want and why are you disturbing me\".

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified | A simple story with an unfortunate outcome that really could happen to anyone. My partner and I recently started working after studying purchased two tickets to travel from London City Airport to Frankfurt. When we purchased the tickets, I mistakenly entered my name twice (e.g. Mr John Smith and Ms John Smith). Little did we know that our 1 simple mistake would cost us over 300 pounds. Upon arriving at the airport we were told there was no way to change the name (apparently they can only change 3 letters where there has been a typo?) and I had no other option to purchase the last remaining ticket if I wanted to board the flight - the price: almost seven times (!) higher than my original ticket. Zero empathy was shown. Zero alternative was offered. Trusting BA's staff and under the pretence that there was apparently no other way we could board the flight we bought this ticket. Immediately after I purchased the ticket I contacted BA's 'Commercial Change Booking Team' and informed them of our situation. The service representative apologised and told me they could have changed the name at the cost of a small fee. He offered to cancel my original ticket and issue me a partial refund then, advising me that I had a claim to the difference and I should contact Customer Support to do so. I told this person several times I wanted to claim the cost of the new ticket and even asked him explicitly if by accepting this offer, I would be denied from claiming the cost of the new ticket. He said no, I could claim the difference. Fair enough - we accepted this offer and lodged a ticket with Customer Support for the difference. Two days later, British Airways Customer Response informed us that we were unable to lodge a claim because we had 'voluntarily accepted the cancellation before the flight'. They've continued to send generic emails until this week, when they just stopped responding. So in short, British Airways misled and deceived my partner into accepting a lowball offer to waive our right to claim a refund. It keeps me up at night thinking how they can do this and get away with it so easily.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified | A supremely awful experience from beginning to end. Flight to Vancouver delayed by 4 hours due to a plane defect that had been resolved the previous day but somehow no attempt made to make up the time in between. Only told once on board what the problem was. Delays at baggage reclaim meant I didn’t get out of Vancouver airport until after midnight (originally scheduled to arrive 6.55pm). This affected a camping trip, the booking for which could not be changed. Flight home marred by massive queues at baggage check in and on the plane, due to IT faults, none of which were communicated until we were seated on the plane and told they could not leave until passenger information could get through to the crew. Due to more IT faults the inflight entertainment was not working so nothing to watch for the 9 hour flight. Food was awful and we got a choice of one meal. Spent hours at Heathrow airport awaiting my flight home to Inverness only to be told by text one hour before departure that it was cancelled. Queued for hours to get some information from someone. They rebooked me on a flight for 26 hours later without checking this was ok - only discovered it was over a day later when I was handed my boarding pass. This means I’ve missed a trip with friends to the Edinburgh festival. Had to source my own hotel and food etc and reclaim on expenses - a lot of money coming out of my account whilst I wait for this. Now I’m seeing my rebooked flight is already delayed and was told by customer service that there’s no telling whether my bags will arrive with me - I have to wait at baggage reclaim and see! If they are not on the flight I have no information as to when I can expect to have my belongings back with me. These are merely the most significant issues, there were more and I’m really shocked at what a consistently terrible service has been provided. Between this, massive fines for data breaches and the fact that BA seem to have quite consistent and severe issues with IT, it is beyond my comprehension how they can still be in business.':\n",

Although the flight was about 30 minutes delayed due to an aircraft change from an Airbus A319 to and Airbus A320, we arrived only slightly behind the scheduled arrival time. The crew were welcoming and informative and the plane was very clean (probably because the plane was relatively new). The seat was not too bad either with quite good leg room. One small issue that I could raise is that there was no complimentary food and beverage on board, you had to pay or use Avios (it isn't that bad as it was only to Europe).

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified | Absolutely pathetic business class product. BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market. With old outdated 8 across seating - no, I did not make a typing mistake - you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access. The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats. BA, like most other European-based airlines does not have a factual Intra-European business class product even though they promote & sell business class. Intra-Europe flights feature the same 3+3 seating throughout the aircraft & the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in \"business class\" & passengers get a meal & drinks, but this does not justify the higher cost. BA's Trans-Atlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the \"narrow\" 8 across seating. The biggest surprise on both the LIS/LHR & LHR/IAH flights was that BA has, in fact, substantially improved their food quality. Shocking! Unfortunately, it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown. The entertainment  system & small screens - my laptop screen is twice the size - is like an airline offering 2 decades ago. The flight crew was \"pleasant & perfunctory\" which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew. BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore, Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, EVA, ANA, Japan, Air New Zealand, Qantas or many others. BA can compete with US-based airlines like Delta, American & United, which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a high-quality business class product. One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats, even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class. Several hundred US dollars for Trans-Atlantic flights. Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost. Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain.':\n",

T5 was blissfully quiet, with no queues at check-in or security, and even the Galleries South lounge was less frenetic than usual, despite families with kids similarly desperate to escape Boris Johnson’s bully boy attitude. Ordering food and beverages from one’s table seems something worth continuing, avoiding all the wastage of endlessly replenished buffets. The flights was very quiet, with just 30 pax on board, 9 of whom were in Club Europe. Boarding by row also seemed a welcome improvement on the previous ‘groups’.

These seats are a huge improvement on the old yin-yang CW seats in terms of privacy, ease of access and the IFE screen, but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flat. Storage was a mixed blessing, too, with three rather fussy little compartments rather than the decent sized drawer in the old CW, meaning that a laptop would have to be stored above. The food onboard was woeful, although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service isn't dragged out. Cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm, and there were the usual queues for the toilets. The flight itself was uneventful and landing was more or less on time.

The Club Suite cabins were about 3/4 full, but the rest of the plane can't have been much more than 20% occupancy. Whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the bare minimum is hard to say, but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins. Despite that, the drink and food service in business was efficient, and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was done and dusted two hours after take-off, which is a real bonus on a night-time flight. However, the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible. The Club Suite is a big improvement on the ancient CW product, although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartphone or two. One definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old CW. The large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole IFE system was much more responsive. The new seats don't significantly aid sleeping, particularly as there's an obvious ridge at the level of the base of the spine. Waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to get breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets.

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified | Dubai to London Heathrow. I flew on the A350 on one of its first trips and will be flying it again. On the same multi segment trip I tried SQ business class and EK business class (and sadly the old BA business class on an aging B777) on overnight trips. The new \"business suite\" offering from BA is the best business class I have experienced. I am a BA Gold card holder and the experience was outstanding. The First lounge at DXB was very good with plenty of seating and a good choice of drinks. Food choice in the lounge was limited but not an issue. On board the new suite was very comfortable and I had a great nights sleep with the closed door making all the difference to getting a full six hours in. The bed was very comfortable. Food choices were very limited (soup and sandwiches) although this did suit the timing of the flight. I would say this is an excellent very serious business product for night time business travellers. Whether it works for leisure travellers who want to wow rather than sleep or daytime travellers I don't know, but I certainly could work very effectively in my suite. Downside is the IFE is still rubbish in relation to the rest of the product.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified | Having booked this flight a week before the BA strike and mistakingly thinking that the strike would have ended two days before I flew and not in fact the day before, I was apprehensive as to how it would operate. The check-in and security clearance at T5 took only 15 minutes. Personally I do not like the self service bag and tag drop that BA operate as one is not 100% confident that I did everything correctly. Boarding is by the new fare group system (1 to 5) which depends on how much one has paid for the ticket. Again I'm not a fan of this. Possibly due to the previous day's strike and the need to accommodate passengers from canceled flights, the aircraft was a large A321. Boarding was however smooth. On board the virtually full cabin was very clean and the EuroTraveller seats were comfortable and offer sufficient leg room (I'm 1m.79cm and my knees do not touch the seat in front). The departure was only 15 minutes behind the scheduled departure time. In flight there were 3 cabin staff in the Euro Traveller cabin (believe 2 in Club cabin) who were very efficient and friendly and so one only had to wait no more than 30 minutes from take off to purchase refreshments on such a full flight. Again it is a shame though that BA have gone down the no frills line and charge for food and drinks when they describe themselves as a full service airline. The landing at Tegel was 30 minutes ahead of schedule. All in all it was a pleasant flight and the value was very good as it was combined with a hotel booking. Tegel itself is a bit of hassle with only 2 border police carrying out immigration controls for over 200 passengers at the end of the airbridge and a further 30 minute wait for luggage but this was not BA's fault.':\n",

The outbound flight from Miami was delayed and we were further delayed when our gate was occupied when we arrived in Heathrow. The total delay was roughly an hour, but it was enough to make our connection a challenge, where we had 73 minutes between original arrival time until the departure time to Dublin. When we headed to our connection flight, we were stopped by security personnel at a checkpoint and told us that the gate to our connection flight had already closed. This was twenty minutes prior to departure time. They ushered us to customer service to be rebooked. Given the busy weekend of travel, we were rebooked on a flight at a different airport and were told that our cost to get there would be reimbursed. We then waited 3 hours for our luggage, and then took a cab to London's City Airport. The cab fare was roughly $500. When I filed a claim with British Airways, they refused the claim and told me that we had plenty of time to make our connecting flight and therefore they denied my claim to be reimbursed for the cab fare. This is after I explained that it was British Airways employees who ushered us to rebook the flight despite the 20 minute timeframe to make the connecting flight.

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified | Johannesburg to Cape Town return. This flight was operated by Comair, and thus it was quite different from a normal British Airways flight in Europe. Check in at the priority line was uneventful, however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that Oneworld Sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if I was flying business. Johannesburg airport and Cape Town's domestic terminal is laid out very similarly. Their lounge, called SLOW is actually impressive. Although there was no full english on offer unlike the British Airways Galleries lounges in other places, there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks, pastries and small bites. They even had a coffee counter with made-to-order drinks. I assume later in the day this also becomes a bar serving alcohol. Very impressive for a domestic business class lounge. Priority boarding was honoured, and boarding was an orderly process. I would recommend anybody wanting to get an extra legroom seat to reserve row 6, as there is actually tons of legroom in front. I reserved an exit row and paid an extra £7 per exit row during the booking. These seats were old and plush, however I do prefer the newer leather seat used on their European aircraft as those offer better support. I had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats, in a 2x3 configuration. I did not expect this as business class in Europe is normally just a blocked middle seat. There were several drink services on this two hour flight, and a hot breakfast with either a bacon, sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with vegetables option. Needless to say, a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated. It was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh. The crew were very friendly, making casual jokes and giving a down-to-earth friendliness you rarely get on airlines these days. They were quite rushed, but understandable due to the short flight time. In Cape Town airport, it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplane/board. But since it took only 15 minutes to board a rather full 737, it works and makes sense. I think that this flight has improved my opinion on British Airways, and they were the same price as the competition, South African Airways. I would be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare, given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on Africa's busiest air route. For the price paid, I'd be happy to fly them again.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified | Just before the borders were closed in South Africa due to Corona Virus, I went to the Airport to find out if the flight scheduled will fly as planned, there was no international flight customer service staff available so I was not able to get a response, the only number available was a UK number which will cost me more than a flight to enquire. Next day I managed to get on board the flight. Sadly due to my fault, I forgot my laptop inside the Aircraft on arrival to terminal 5. I was one of the last passengers to leave the plane. I realised my mistake after I passed security and I was not allowed back into the Airport to collect my laptop which is fair enough and I understand why I could not go back to the Aircraft. They gave me a number to call and I have been calling the number since March, so far it has been zero positive response because they are using a third party company to help you which has zero interest to help you find your lost items. Basically BA does not have means in place for passengers to find their items. My laptop was left inside the flight hence it is impossible for crew staff and cleaning staff to not find it hence I just can not understand how they can not find it bearing in mind it was 100% left inside the plane. Lessons learned, avoid if you can. ':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified | London to Belfast. British Airways bullied my parents and spoilt a special occasion. I booked my parents on BA to attend my investiture at the Palace. My mother had a heart attack 3 months ago and this was her first flight post recovery and I had chosen BA expecting the best level of service. Instead they were treated appallingly and felt bullied by the airline staff. My mother suffers from claustrophobia and always requests an aisle seat and I booked my parents on 2 aisle seats side by side. I printed their boarding passes out myself with seats 24c and 24d. On arrival at check-in, one of the boarding passes was not recognised by the scanner so assistance printed out a new one. On going through security the boarding pass was again not recognised and a new pass was printed. Once my parents arrived at the gate they noticed that one of the seats had been changed. My father explained the situation but the rep at check-in started quoting the ‘Geneva convention’ that BA are only contracted to get them from A to B and could change seats if they wanted. Waiting at the gate to try and resolve the situation and eventually with 5 minutes before airborne they were rushed into the aircraft and forced to sit apart with no care for their welfare or circumstances. At no stage did they receive any apologetic words. For someone recovering from a heart attack, this was an unnecessary stressful event and spoilt what had been a special family occasion. I have been holding on with the hope that BAs slide from grace will halt but seem to be constantly disappointed. I will await BAs response to my parents; I know they will not fly the carrier again but I will be handing back my BA Amex and all points if an appropriate apology is not issued. Will update! In summary, don’t trust BA with your loved ones care.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified | London to Malaga. A terminally ill airline packed with clueless staff full of attitude. At the checking at Gatwick airport, I was told the flight might well be delayed of 2h as not departed yet from Malaga. SMS confirmed the delay without a new time of departure and provided a link for flight status. At Gatwick, there are no arrival/departure boards prior to security for me to check if the flight was on time as shown online. When asked the BA guy at the lounge kiosk, he said I could check the link provided or go through security where monitors are. Surprisingly the flight was on time and no text was sent for an update. At the gate, we were told the aircraft was replaced. No apologies from anyone neither ground nor on the flight. We boarded at 5 pm and took off at 18:15. Stiff and no recliner seats. Cabin crew are so sociopathic and full of attitudes. 6 additional seats are replacing the 2 toilets located at the back of the 320 and located at the very far end of the aircraft in the cabin crew storage room and working space is.

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified | Much better experience this time around. Flew CPT to LHR on a new A350. Checkin was efficient. I used the Bidvest lounge at CPT as it is better than BA's lounge. Boarding was speedy. The new business class club suites are very good. Slightly irritating to be directed to the wrong seat (1A instead of 1K) which meant that after settling in the passenger in 1A showed up. We arranged a seat switch. Second time in a row it has happened. Why can't BA staff memorise which side of the plane is which and get it right? Captain's announcement was short and on point. Welcome drink was served at the correct temperature i.e. cold (first time ever for me - previously BA has always served the welcome champagne warm). IFE system was good - everything worked as it should. Felt slightly cheap that business class passengers have to pay for wifi. I did not bother. Cocktail was good. The nuts came on a cheap plastic tray which was naff ... other airlines bring out something classier. A female flight attendant came to take my order and I asked for Rooibas panacotta and the chicken breast. She repeated back to me \"so you want a P and a C\". It was such a bizarre thing to say that I misheard. I thought she said \"so you want beef and sea\"? Confusion reigned until she explained to me she had a checklist of passenger orders and they abbreviate to first letters so she was saying \"P\" for panacotta and \"C\" for chicken. But how bizarre to repeat back an order to a passenger in code. Why not just say, \"so to confirm panacotta to start and chicken as your main dish\", like every other restaurant / airline does in the world? The internal coding of food ordering is exactly that - internal. She even looked irritated at me that I did not understand her jargon first time. The food, when it came, was excellent. Much much better than recent flights. I read somewhere that BA changed caterer. If so, it shows. The panacotta was superb as was the chicken ... good restaurant quality. The wine was OK to good but definitely not good to excellent. I feel that while the food has got better in BA business class, the wines have got worse. Certainly compared to Air France which I have also flown recently. The wine was brought out on time (not afer I finished eating as it was lass time I flew BA business). Cheese was also good and not teeth crackingly cold as last time. I had a good night's sleep. Plenty of snacks out if you wanted them (and they did not run out). Breakfast was excellent and the coffee was hot (previously it has been lukewarm). So all in all a vastly improved service offering. The staff seemed rushed off their feet ... it would not hurt to have an extra flight attendant to look after so many business class seats. Overall summary: vastly improved passenger proposition. It would be 10/10 but I deduct a point for showing me to the wrong seat and another point for the bizarre interaction with the female flight attendant who repeated my food order back to me using internal jargon codes.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified | New York to Glasgow via London. A routine and smooth overnight flight that departed the gate about 45 minutes late because of a security issue at the terminal (#7). I had an electronic boarding pass on the BA app but an announcement was made that we needed to get paper versions. There was a separate desk where a couple of agents performed this task. The pilot introduced the flight attendants as “gorgeous” - which came across to me as inappropriate. I would have preferred efficient or even helpful to describe them. I had an aisle seat in a 3-3-3 seat layout. The middle seat was unoccupied. Enough leg space and storage space overhead. A good collection of all sorts of movies with free headphones provided. The IFE system was easy to use. A drink service preceded the meal service. I asked for a beer and was cheerfully offered their centenary year specially brewed IPA Brewdog Speedbird 100. Sensing that I might not enjoy it, the attendant also gave me a Heineken and a bottle of wine to accompany the dinner that followed soon thereafter. The entree choices were chicken and pasta. I chose the later. Very basic food. Tea and coffee followed. Before landing a sandwich and a drink was served. I could not figure out what was in the sandwich! The bathroom was clean. Blankets and pillows were on every seat. Alighting was quick. Landing cards have been done away with. For the fare, I paid I was satisfied - no complaints. I connected to a domestic flight to Glasgow. The announcement of the gate was made quite late. Newspapers were available at the gate - a worthy amenity. It was a smooth flight in a 3-3 seating. I was in an aisle seat, the next to me was empty. No complimentary food or drink on this segment. The two flight attendants, once the plane reached cruising altitude, put on aprons and pushed a cart down the aisle hawking edibles and elixirs. The pilot introduced them as gorgeous. Both on this and the earlier flight, a video presentation showed off the safety instructions. It was supposed to be funny and engaging. I felt it was neither - the accents of the actors were hard to understand. The flight landed on time. Overall, a positive experience but next time I will look into a non-stop flight to Glasgow from New York. The transfer at Heathrow is anxiety-inducing.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified | On the memorable day of January 9th, my family and I embarked on a journey from London Heathrow, Terminal 5, destined for Glasgow. Little did we anticipate the series of events that would unfold, shaping our travel experience into a tale of exceptional service and unwavering dedication. As we navigated the bustling corridors of the airport, our journey encountered an unexpected hurdle. It was at this juncture that I found myself grappling with booking complications, compounded by banking delays. Amid this quandary, I sought assistance from British Airways personnel at Terminal 5, hoping to salvage our travel plans. Enter Mr. Sathies, a beacon of hope amidst the chaos. With a demeanour exuding empathy and professionalism, Mr. Sathies swiftly assessed the situation at hand. Despite the setback, he wasted no time in springing into action, exploring every avenue to mitigate the impact of the unforeseen challenges we faced. The sequence of events unfolded with remarkable clarity as Mr Sathies tirelessly liaised with various stakeholders, including senior colleagues and his managerial counterpart, Mr Gurvir Singh Dhillon. Their collaborative efforts culminated in a solution that exceeded all expectations. Through Mr. Sathies' unwavering dedication and Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon's steadfast support, our travel arrangements were salvaged without incurring any additional costs. Despite the initial uncertainty, my family and I were able to proceed with our journey, embarking on our flight to Glasgow with a renewed sense of gratitude and appreciation for the exceptional service rendered by British Airways. As I reflect upon the precise sequence of events that transpired on that fateful day, I am filled with profound gratitude towards Mr. Sathies, Mr. Gurvir Singh Dhillon, and the entire British Airways team.

As a result of the delay we missed our connecting flight from Heathrow and instead of putting us on the next connection they chose the second last flight of the day - which was also delayed by over an hour meaning we had an additional 4 hour delay whilst at Heathrow. At no point were we advised about our compensation rights (despite asking at check in and connections) or provided any vouchers during the delays.

Despite paying well over the odds for business class, we were booted out of the BA lounge two hours before the flight. When it was finally cancelled, the BA staff. Without explanation, told everyone to go to a gate. After another hour or so they made us re enter the UK via passport control, a further 40 minute wait. By now the airport was closing and there was no sign of our bags or any help from BA. A passing Gatwick engineer finally helped us locate the bags. BA completely washed their hands of us and in contravention of CAA rules refused to find us accommodation. Many slept in a bus stop overnight. There were people with young children who couldn’t find somewhere to stay and yet BA had closed down and left. The following day the replacement flight was also late and due to an admin mistake had no catering or liquids for a 2 1/2 hr flight.

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified | One would think that the number of crises BA incurs they would have had emergency planning down to a fine art. I last flew with BA May 2017 - yes, the weekend of the last but one IT crisis. I swore never again but ended up purchasing a ticket Aug 2018 to Bologna - BA cancelled the flight. Then covid hit so ended up with a voucher. Fast forward to Feb 26th, 2022. Received a message 5.30am 30mins from LHR that that my flight was cancelled. Arrived at the airport with everyone else just wandering and seeking answers. The staff that were there either told you to go online - a bit difficult as the BA systems were down or ring BA. Ha Ha or go home - not very helpful if you live two hours from LHR. By some miracle the app sprung into life, and I managed to get one of the last 10 seats on the evening flight. Sat in arrivals as there was a coffee shop - soon ran out of seats. By 12.00 midday most of us were trying to get airside to use lounges but no one was allowed in departures until two hours prior to your flight supposedly because of crowds. Pointed out BA should have provided refreshments - told to put a claim in. Eventually got to departures and made it through security. BA customer services (note the oxymoron) - had a consistent queue of about 20 people as BA were still cancelling/rearranging flights for passengers who were airside. Boarded flight 45mins late. Sat on tarmac as the pilot told us the delay was them trying to 'reconcile' luggage. When we took off given one very small bottle of water and a cereal bar for a five-hour flight They purport to be a top-class airline but in fact Ryanair has more finesse. The staff are fine but can be miserable because they are treated so badly and like to remind you that they are doing their best in a difficult situation - well so are the passengers. The aircraft are cramped and worn. I had been reluctant to use Egyptair but flew home with them on a new aircraft with a very good entertainment system and was provided with a hot meal and snack for same price as a BA ticket. How on earth can BA justify their prices? The management should be sacked as ultimately they are to blame for the ruination of this airline.':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified | Probably the worst business class experience I've ever had on an airline. Just a few of the issues: Required to purchase seats on international (Club World) business class. This was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional $600 on a single leg (LHR-LAX) for a family of four. Given the very strange business class seating layout on BA A380s, leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family. Ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft. On my VIE-LHR leg, the boarding time for the A320 was over 50 minutes long, leading to a delayed departure. There was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times. Severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite C of terminal 5 at Heathrow. Boarding staff would not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding (I have no idea why not) and so crowding was extreme. The overall boarding area was far too small for an A380, and I believe this satellite was designed and built after the first A380s were delivered. Online check-in in advance of flights appears to be completely broken. I was urged repeatedly (on the BA website, and via email and text) to \"upload my COVID documents\" even though, at the end of 2022, there are no COVID documents required for travel. After I filled in basic contact information on the website - and did not upload any \"COVID documentation\" - I was informed (several hours later) that my \"COVID documents have been verified\". I then received another text message urging me to \"upload my COVID documentation\". On the VIE-LHR leg, the shop.ba.com page that one is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times - over six hours, and then four hours just before landing. BA lounges for Club Europe and Club World at Heathrow are often seriously overcrowded. Furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty. That said, the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality. The food quality in BA lounges at Heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline. Onboard, food and beverage service was far below average for international business class. Terrible, one might say. On the LHR-LAX leg, there was no pre-meal beverage service and there were NO mid-flight beverage services at all. Unlike most business class offerings on other airlines, there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight. Meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off, with the \"chicken or fish?\" type of meal selection similar to economy class. There was no coffee or tea service after meals. Food quality was poor, with the pre-landing snack of a \"ploughman's lunch\" being downright disgusting. . There was no beverage or bar set-up in the galley areas - beverages available to passengers during the flight - as is standard on most international business class offerings. Even bottles of water seemed be hidden away, requiring one to ask the flight attendants for water. I won't comment on the bizarre seating layout on the A380, as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating. The seats are not 6' 2\" long as stated on the BA website, and I found the seats too short for my 6' 2\" height. The \"Priority\" luggage tags were not followed in the baggage delivery.':\n",

They gave me toothpaste and a toothbrush, which was ok, and fast track invitation, which was useless, since no fast track is offered to British passports. I was not given a menu, I even had to ask for it. I was not served the meal and they said it was because I was sleeping. Ok fine but even when I was awake, no one bothered to ask me about the meal. I had to ask for the menu, a bottle of water, and the meal. And after all, no apologies from the staff. Too many people are squeezed into business class. Even though I could lie down 180 degrees, I had very little space at my seat. Given the very expensive fare, I expected a much better service for business class passengers. I'm very disappointed and will never use it again. I won't recommend British Airways business class to anyone!':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified | Stinking nappies being changed in business cabin throughout flight to Miami. Four of us from one family were travelling British Airways business. I am a British Airways gold card member. I have been a member of British Airways Executive Club since 1979. We only ever fly British Airways, in first class or business class. It has become a habit to fly BA and we do this because we trust them for safety. We have regular long haul flights booked with British Airways in both first and business into next year. We often fly to the USA. Both my wife and I used to have Virgin Atlantic gold cards however we sadly returned to BA because Virgin did not have a first class seat product. Even so the service from virgin’s gold card department was off the scale, absolutely brilliant and we loved the Virgin lounge at Heathrow. Our flight to Miami with British Airways was on one of their double decker aircraft. These are just too big and I believe contributed to the appalling service. Perhaps familiarity breeds contempt however, whether in business or first, I now view BA aircraft as just being dirty buses in the sky. The food is not much better. However, our flight was distinguished by the smell of poo throughout the journey caused by mothers of babies, changing nappies within the business class cabin, instead of doing it where they should be doing it, in the WC. Try enjoying lunch with a glass of wine with air around permeated by the smell of poo. There must have been three or four babies, having nappies changed regularly in our cabin. I can put up with the screaming because that can’t be helped, but not poo. Cabin crew did nothing about it, despite being asked. I Telephoned BA customer services and ended up speaking to a lady in Manchester BA office who told me that she was BA cabin crew for many years. She told me that changing nappies in the cabin should not be allowed, that it is completely unacceptable and particularly awful while passengers are trying to enjoy a meal. My wife and I are flying first class British Airways again to the USA in April and we also have first class tickets to the USA booked for December. I sent in a complaint to BA customer relations on behalf of all four members of my family who travelled British Airways on December 19 to Miami from LHR and had to put up with the disgusting smells which at times were quite dreadful. I received a response offering a £300 voucher or 30,000 Avios. so, given the cost of four business class flights to Miami from London, British Airways value the loss of enjoyment through travelling in a stinking cabin, at £75 per passenger! Given that I am a gold card holder, an extremely good customer, clearly in the top one percent of all BA customers and a gold cardholder, if that is how they behave with me, God knows how they behave with everybody else. All I can tell you is that flying with Virgin Atlantic when I was a Gold member was highly positive. When our children were young, we used to fly BA first class at times and we would not dream of changing a nappy in the cabin! Not in any cabin! When I complained to British Airways, I asked them if changing of nappies in first class would be allowed during dinner service and they ignored the question. I have numerous business class flights booked with BA over the course of the next 12 months as well as first class flight booked. ':\n",

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified | Terrible Experience with British Airways. I booked a flight with BA to travel from Gibraltar to London Heathrow on May 10, 2023. My flight was scheduled to leave at 4:00 p.m. in the afternoon. I had originally planned on leaving my luggage at Heathrow upon arrival and travelling to visit and overnight at my cousin's place. En route to GIB airport a few hours prior to departure, I checked my flight details and found out that my flight had been cancelled. I had a connecting flight booked with Westjet from London Heathrow to Vancouver the following day and I had to make that flight, so it was imperative that I got to London. I checked the BA website and couldn't find any other flights with them that would work, so unfortunately I made the mistake of requesting a refund. I managed to find a flight out of Malaga that got me into London just after 10:00 p.m. so I booked that and then called British Airways as I wanted to discuss compensation. That's when they advised me that because I had requested a refund (they used the phrase \"abandoned\" travel with them), they were not prepared to do anything for me. Apparently, I should have called them first, and then they would have made the arrangements. Of course they don't explain that on their website - they just ask if you want a refund and then proceed. And even when I plead my case with the agent at Malaga airport and then followed up with Customer Relations several times via email, they flat out refused to budge. I had used a travel voucher to cover the cost of my flight and had used Avios to cover the cost of my checked baggage, so in other words no out of pocket costs for the trip. Once this incident happened, I ended up spending 660 euros in airfare and checked baggage charges to get to London from Malaga (i.e., different airport than the one I had originally booked from). And because the luggage storage facility at Heathrow had closed by the time I eventually arrived, I ended up booking a night at a hotel since I couldn't travel by train to my cousin's place any longer (3 bags in tow) and I didn't want to put him out and have him drive to the airport to pick me up. This cost me another £125 in room and meal costs. All BA ended up doing to compensate me was to give me 5,000 free Avios - a mere pittance compared to my out of pocket expenses. Despite trying to explain to them why I requested the refund instead of calling them first, they wouldn't budge. Very easy for them to say what I should have done since they work there and know the rules and they weren't the ones scrambling to find alternative travel arrangements within a few hours. I pointed out that on their website they should simply instruct customers to call them when this situation happens, and that way they would never encounter this problem. My feeling is that they put the refund option out there in the hope that customers will make the mistake I did so they can then wash their hands of the situation and ultimately save money. I've been an Executive Club member for years and they simply didn't care. They said there was nothing they could do. I'm sure if one of the BA executive's friends or family members had gone through this, staff there would have been given the instruction to make things right. I used to be a fan of BA but they have really gone downhill in my opinion. Once I used up my remaining Avios and travel credit, I will cancel my Executive Club membership and never fly with them again.':\n",

On board was what all this flight was about. This was my first time flying Intra-European Business Class, and though I was well prepared, I still found it underwhelming. First, the seat is just a normal economy seat, with the middle seat blocked off. There is no personal IFE, so basically no entertainment for a 3-hour flight. Meal service was very slow, and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin, one of the 2 choices ran out, plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal I got on my Turkish Airlines flight a few days ago. I could see that staff did their best, but since there were 32 business class passengers on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley, there was so much they could do. Also, the 32 passengers shared one single WC, meaning a long line for the bath room, something I have rarely seen in business class. Arrived at LHR, we did not get a contact gate, but the thing was that there was no bus either, and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus would come. It finally came, of course, and the delay was more on the airport than the airline, but since BA is the main operator at Heathrow T5, such things will affect their reputation.':\n",

It’s confusing, which makes it not dependable. Cabin baggage is in theory generous compared to competitors in economy but then they asked more than half the passengers on this flight to check in the cabin baggage at the gate due to lack of space in the overhead cabins, leading to long boarding delays. Their whole offering hasn’t been thought through very well .

Flight to the US, including mine, departed from concourse C of Terminal 5 which did not have many shopping or dining options. However, it was quiet so finding seating was quite easy. The highlight is the Club Suite, which is spacious and provides a great deal of privacy. Meal service was slow, and everything was served on one tray, all at once. I think now is the time for them to begin to get back to pre-pandemic standard.

I had one checked bag that was lost at Heathrow Airport. I am aware that at that time there was a system error with the baggage belt and many travelers were affected. I filed a report for my missing bag on the same day I arrived at LAX airport, and that was on August 21st. I waited patiently for three weeks (which is the time frame to either find the bag or be eligible for a compensation). When I did not receive any update on my lost bag, I filed a claim for compensation, and that was on September 11th. Since then, I have been waiting for a response from the customer relation with no good signs of resolving the issue. I emailed them and tried to update the claim but still no response until today. I contacted the baggage team and they were not helpful and did not ease my prolonged waiting. The only way to contact customer relations is via the website and they're not even getting back to me. Every time I talk to a customer service agent, they tell me to wait some more. I have been waiting for almost three months now and my issue is not resolved yet. This whole experience was a hassle.

I fly British Airways around six times a month thanks to my work, and while I almost always have a pleasant experience, this past flight definitely outdid all the others. We boarded and departed exactly on time, with a very friendly and welcoming crew. While the flight was fully booked, my travel companion and I were lucky that no one was sitting on our row so that we could have an empty middle seat, and therefore more space. The best surprise of this flight by far was the availability of Wi-Fi which I have never had on any other British Airways flight within Europe. In fact, the Wi-Fi package I got which included only texting, was unlimited and incredibly fast - as good as my home connection! This truly made this flight more enjoyable as it allowed me to continue my business even during the flight which is extremely valuable to me. Something that British Airways can improve on would be leg space, which in this flight I noticed was particularly tight, although that is a common problem for me as I am 1.88 cm tall. Also, for unknown reasons, no food or snacks were served on this 2 hours 45 minute flight, only drinks. This was a slight struggle as I had skipped breakfast, but I managed well.

      "Top features for class '✅ Trip Verified | We have flown with British Airways a few times but this last trip was by far the worst experience. We weren't able to check in online because the system wouldn't accept any of our passport info, so we had to wait to check in upon arrival at the airport. We arrived two hours before our scheduled departure. The line was backed up with only 4 stations being staffed where there was room for at least 6 more attendants to help expedite check in. We talked to a few people in line and they too were unable to check in online. It took the desk attendants an hour to check in the people ahead of us. We told the agent we had tried to check in online but it wouldn't accept our passports, she replied it was because they need to verify each passport personally. I asked that wouldn't they verify them that way anyway? I also let her know we attempted to move closer to the front of the plane and could see there were seats available but couldn't secure them because we couldn't finish check in. She went on to tell us it's a full flight so we wouldn't be able to choose our seats. We reached the gate and ask the agents there about moving to another section and she confirmed there was no availability. During the flight, the service was not what we expected based on previous flights. We only saw the flight attendants during food service and twice to pickup trash. Every time I went to the lavatory, there were at least 6-8 attendants standing around chatting, instead of taking care of the passengers. The attendants seemed uninterested and inexperienced, even snapping at a confused passenger regarding their seat belt. The flight attendants were disappointing to say the least. No available air control vents above us, so no option to have any air flow other than what the whole plane had. Upon landing, we went to the baggage carousel to claim our bags. An hour later, still no bags. Finally a message came over the loudspeakers that the elevator on the plane was broken and the ETA of the bags was still unknown. About 30 minutes later, the bags started to slowly appear on the belt. Overall, this was the worst BA flight we've experienced.':\n",

We just had one bad experience after another on this route in July 2021.  British Airways (BA) notified us that our connection flight to Nice was bumped from 2pm to 6pm so we had to spend an extra 4 hours in the airport during this COVID era. Their website and emails prior to our day of flight kept asking us to check UK.gov for the COVID rules and regulations for transit through London which said that no COVID test was necessary if we could show proof of vaccine, however upon our arrival at the airport they told us we needed to go to the basement to take a COVID test to show negative results. They charged us $250 per person for a rapid COVID test which was an outrage and totally unnecessary. We could have gotten the test done at a cheaper rate had we known that this was a requirement prior to our flight. Food service was horrible (they served food with lots of cheese to me while I had requested a vegan meal due to may dairy allergies). BA damaged our Samsonite luggage and they told us at the airport that we needed to report this online.

Although the check-in process was relatively quick, there was a noticeable lack of staff—another apparent cost-cutting measure by BA. Upon arriving in Hannover, I found that my luggage hadn't made it to the airport, and there were no staff to assist. I had to file a report online. The following day, I received a call saying my luggage would arrive on a later flight, but this didn't help me since German shops are closed on Sundays, leaving me without essential items. As a result, I was confined to my hotel, unable to attend any planned events because I didn't have suitable clothing. When my luggage eventually reached the Hannover airport, I got a call from BA informing me that they couldn't deliver it for another day or two. They advised me to take a taxi to pick it up and said I could claim back the cost, but when I submitted my claim, BA refused to cover the taxi expenses. They also declined to offer compensation for the inconvenience caused by the delayed baggage, even though it disrupted a full day of my trip. Service on my return flight from Frankfurt was also below par from the ground crew at Frankfurt airport who were slow & rude at check in. BA's customer service has declined significantly, now resembling the level of budget airlines like EasyJet and Ryanair—but at a premium price.

Premium security at Gatwick is fine. The flight was delayed due to NATS issues, but the member of staff on arriving at the lounge let me know of this. The lounge is nicevand it’ very comfortable. There was an excellent range of food and drinks. All the drinks you would expect. Food wise there were sandwiches, soup, pasta, salads, fruit, Spanish stew, as well as turkey and ham pies with mashed potato, roasted parsnips and carrots and gravy. It was all really good and particularly nice to see so many options. Boarding was pretty slow, although the gate crew did a good job to keep it well organised and allow priority passengers to board first. As has been well documented the onboard experience in terms of seat on ba Europe business is pretty poor, but in line with other European carriers sadly. That being said, the seat is well padded and comfortable and the adjustable headrest is quite good. The on board catering was of excellent quality. I was lucky to get my preferred option of the roast turkey, but several people sat near me weren’t as lucky. I do understand that meal options may run out but when the meal options are roast turkey with all the trimmings, vegetarian cottage pie or a chicken salad you really should be stocking enough for every passenger to get the proper meal  Or failing that, allow an order in advance service where you then only stock the meals that people want to eat. Whilst I fully support the desire to minimise waste, both food and cost, people really should really be able to get the ideal meal option. Unfortunately one of the people affected reacted very badly to this and took it out on the cabin crew which is unacceptable.. they also lost a bit of perspective about just how serious a situation it actually was! The cabin crew were  very nice, friendly and professional, if a little slow.. but not to the point of detracting from the positive experience I had. The ground service at Gran Canaria was pretty poor, priority bags clearly meant nothing. 95% of bags coming out were not priority, mine came out about halfway through bag delivery and demonstrates poor delivery of service and not  fulfilling on the service they promise to their customers.

A single BA staff member turned up to board a full flight shortly before the flight was due to depart. There had been no previous announcement of the delay. Once on board the captain blamed Frankfurt ground staff for delaying takeoff when clearly late boarding had resulted in a missed departure slot.':\n",

      "Top features for class '❎ Not Verified | Newcastle to Delhi via London. At check-in , I was charged for carrying 2.8 kilos extra, which is of no problem. I paid a total of £65 for 2.8 kilos. On my flight from London to Delhi, during boarding I asked for water to which the attendant told she would get but she was busy as customers were boarding the flight. I then  asked for a bottle of water  which she seemed to forget.  2 hours into the  journey, my in-flight entertainment system got stuck on the TV and Radio feature. When the dinner was served, Ithe meal consisted of chicken gravy and mash, along with bread butter and a mousse. Delays caused by British Airways resulted in the flight reaching Delhi late and me missing my connecting flight. But as I landed at Delhi and picked my baggage from the belt, a British Airways staff was ready with another ticket from Delhi to Mumbai without me even asking. ':\n",
